        excite.py: fixed a bug with printing MS values in the dialog, fixed a bug with delta pulse selection
        molcas_input.py: rewritten, now also writes proper MOLCAS input files in addition to MOLCAS.template files for the interface
        molpro_input.py: fixed a bug in the check of the CAS size, added check for empty state list, can now write input for EOM-CCSD, CI/MXP-optimization
        setup_init.py: changed to accomodate the new MOLCAS interface
        setup_traj.py: changed to accomodate the new MOLCAS interface, changed to accomodate the new cioverlaps code for COLUMBUS
        SHARC_MOLCAS.py: rewritten, CASPT2 dynamics, dipole/SOC derivatives, parallization
        SHARC_COLUMBUS.py: bugfixes (gethostname, debug features, error messages, molden files), added check for "socdr" keyword, added "ncpu" keyword, changed to accomodate the new cioverlaps code (Felix Plasser, Sebastian Mai, Matthias Ruckenbauer)
        SHARC_MOLPRO.py: bugfixes (gethostname,empty gradient list), added support for command line options to MOLPRO, which will be passed through the interface, uses record 1 instead of 9 now for gradient dumps, also works if CPMCSCF converges in one iteration
