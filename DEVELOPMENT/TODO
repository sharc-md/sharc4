Installation:
- library path, compiler  => install.config



Fortran code:
- Laser field (Granucci paper, Thachuk paper): gradients, radiative/nonradiative hops
- doxygen comments
- substitute real*8 and friends with real(kind=??) stuff


Tutorial:
- Analytical interface
- MOLCAS interface
- mark background infos

Others:
- Git repository
- script for extracting random geometries from trajectories (from/to timestep, which trajectories, ...)



MOLPRO interface:
- allow the interface to do several subsequent calculations (so that it can first do H/DM/SOC/OVERLAP and then the gradients/NACs)
- for SOC/DM, always calculate the OVERLAPS, extract the phases, problem: phases are not in overlap matrix
- CASSCF-CI overlaps for phases: doable, but need to store the CAS and CI coefficients for samestep jobs
  Translation from CASSCF to MRCI wavefunctions:
  * |2000> = |2000>
  * |/\00> = 1/sqrt(2) * [ |ab00> - |ba00> ]
  * |//00> = |aa00>
  * |////> = |aaaa>
