Fortran code:
- Laser field (Granucci paper, Thachuk paper): radiative/nonradiative hops
- other decoherence schemes


Makefile:
- output.f90 needs to be compiled every time, so that the build info is always up-to-date


Tutorial:
- mark background infos
- state that the example figures could also look different (different compilers, etc)
- switch the tutorial to MOLCAS


Manual:
- elaborate more on analysis


Others:
- script for extracting random geometries from trajectories (from/to timestep, which trajectories, ...)
- script for setting up scattering initial conditions (merge two initconds files with Wigner distributions, setting translational and rotational shift and relative translational and rotational velocities)


Diagnostics tool:
- Check trajectories for 
    * total energy conversion (changes per time step, and overall changes), 
    * discontinuities in the potential energies/kinetic energy, 
    * crashes/normal termination, 
    * missing files (output, is it restartable?), 
    * total population (should not be necessary with our propagators),
    * intruder states
    * TODO: also unreasonable hops?
- find maximum usable time for each trajectory



Python:
- question(): add comma-separated lists
- class for understanding ranges:
  for example:
        s = "2,5,7-9,12"
        ranges = (x.split("-") for x in s.split(","))
        print [i for r in ranges for i in range(int(r[0]), int(r[-1]) + 1)]
- delete all with statements




For SHARC workshop:
- SHARC homepage banner als lineal (werbeartikel) machen lassen :D





COLUMBUS interface:
- parallel jobs



MOLCAS interface:
- state-averaging with zero weight extra states
- cleanup keyword


Setup:
- on the fly Dyson norms
- excite.py: initial state different from S0


Analysis:
- TR spectra generation from trajectory data
- TR spectra from a posteriori calculations



Test suite:
- adjust to new MOLCAS interface
- adjust to new MOLPRO interface
- RICC2, ADF, check COLUMBUS




Introduce wfoverlaps to suite
- make $SHARC/wfoverlap.x the default path in setup scripts/interfaces
