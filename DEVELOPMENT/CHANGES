        retrieve.sh: minor bugfix
version 1.1
        excite.py: fixed a bug with printing MS values in the dialog, fixed a bug with delta pulse selection
        molcas_input.py: rewritten, now also writes proper MOLCAS input files in addition to MOLCAS.template files for the interface
        molpro_input.py: fixed a bug in the check of the CAS size, added check for empty state list, can now write input for EOM-CCSD, CI/MXP-optimization
        setup_init.py: changed to accomodate the new MOLCAS interface
        setup_traj.py: changed to accomodate the new MOLCAS interface, changed to accomodate the new cioverlaps code for COLUMBUS
        SHARC_MOLCAS.py: rewritten, CASPT2 dynamics, dipole/SOC derivatives, parallization
        SHARC_COLUMBUS.py: bugfixes (gethostname, debug features, error messages, molden files), added check for "socdr" keyword, added "ncpu" keyword, changed to accomodate the new cioverlaps code (Felix Plasser, Sebastian Mai, Matthias Ruckenbauer)
        SHARC_MOLPRO.py: bugfixes (gethostname,empty gradient list), added support for command line options to MOLPRO, which will be passed through the interface, uses record 1 instead of 9 now for gradient dumps, also works if CPMCSCF converges in one iteration
        wigner.py: reads molden files with less than 3*N_atom normal modes (but issues a warning in this case)
        populations.py: bugfixes (detection of timestep)
        data_extractor.x: added expec_MCH.out output file
        sharc.x: SHARC fun facts, minor changes (error code in output.log)
