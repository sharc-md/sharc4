  abstract = {The first steps in photochemical processes, such as photosynthesis or animal vision, involve changes in electronic and geometric structure on extremely short time scales. Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy is a natural way to measure such changes, but has been hindered hitherto by limitations of available pulsed light sources in the vacuum-ultraviolet and soft X-ray spectral region, which have insufficient resolution in time and energy simultaneously. The unique combination of intensity, energy resolution, and femtosecond pulse duration of the FERMI-seeded free-electron laser can now provide exceptionally detailed information on photoexcitation-deexcitation and fragmentation in pump-probe experiments on the 50-femtosecond time scale. For the prototypical system acetylacetone we report here electron spectra measured as a function of time delay with enough spectral and time resolution to follow several photoexcited species through well-characterized individual steps, interpreted using state-of-the-art static and dynamics calculations. These results open the way for investigations of photochemical processes in unprecedented detail.},

  abstract  = {Obtaining the exciton dynamics of large photosynthetic complexes by using mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is computationally demanding. We propose a machine learning technique{,} multi-layer perceptrons{,} as a tool to reduce the time required to compute excited state energies. With this approach we predict time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) excited state energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations from the predictions. Different methods to determine multi-layer perceptron training sets are introduced{,} leading to several initial data selections. In addition{,} we compute spectral densities and exciton populations. Once multi-layer perceptrons are trained{,} predicting excited state energies was found to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We showed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of QM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors contained within 0.01 eV (0.5%). Spectral densities and exciton dynamics are also in agreement with the TDDFT results. The acceleration and accurate prediction of dynamics strongly encourage the combination of machine learning techniques with ab initio methods.},

  volume    = {8},
  pages     = {6924-6935},
  abstract  = {Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In the present work{,} we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects - typically neglected by conventional quantum chemistry approaches - we base our machine learning strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules{,} we overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning techniques{,} not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude{,} but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this end{,} we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy{,} we are able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference points. This is made possible through the use of molecular forces during neural network potential training and the introduction of a fully automated sampling scheme. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule{,} n-alkanes containing up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide{,} which at the same time represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the dynamics of a peptide. In all of these case studies we find an excellent agreement between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the respective theoretical and experimental spectra.},

	are subject to nonadiabatic evolution, via either internal conversion
	({IC)} back to the ground state or mutagenesis. Nonadiabatic processes
	following the formation of the first singlet excited states, S1,
	in 10 different small {DNA} fragments?4 single {4?H-nucleosides},
	2 {Watson?Crick} base pairs, and 4 nucleotide quartets?have been
	investigated. Simulations were done via the nonadiabatic direct trajectory
	surface hopping semiclassical dynamics. The electronic wave function
	was obtained with configuration interaction, based on the semiempirical
	{AM1} and {PM3} Hamiltonians with fractional orbital occupation numbers.
	The evolution of the electronic wave function was governed by the
	time-dependent Schro?dinger equation with a locally diabatic representation,
	intrinsically stable near surface crossings. The nuclei evolved on
	adiabatic potential energy surfaces, as prescribed by classical Newtonian
	dynamics, with sudden hops between potential energy surfaces to account
	for nonadiabatic transitions. The ?fewest switches? surface hopping
	algorithm coupled the quantum and classical parts of the system.
	The dynamics simulations revealed several routes of nonadiabatic
	relaxation in these systems, which were not reported previously,
	and also recovered known routes of {IC.}},

	first and second derivatives. An example of an {MCSCF} third derivative

	the perturbed wave functions in each order are derived. Some attention
	is given to the efficient computer implementation of derivative calculations,

	with vibrational relaxation (VR). This contradicts the conventional
	cascade model, where \{ISC\} rates are slower than \{VR\} ones. We
	hence investigate the relaxation process with quantum chemical calculations
	and excited-state wavepacket simulations to obtain clues about the
	origins of the ultrafast ISC. It is found that a potential energy
	curve of the 4T2g state crosses those of the 2T1g states near the
	Franck?Condon region and their spin?orbit couplings are strong. Consequently,
	ultrafast \{ISC\} between these states is observed in the wavepacket
	simulation. },

  abstract = {The {Born--Oppenheimer} treatment leads to the adiabatic framework
	where the non-adiabatic terms are the physical entities responsible
	for the coupling between adiabatic states. The main disadvantage
	of this treatment is in the fact that these coupling terms frequently
	become singular thus causing difficulties in solving the relevant
	Schroedinger equation for the motion of the nuclei that make up the
	molecular systems. In this review, we present the line integral approach
	which enables the formation of the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation
	matrix that yields the friendlier diabatic framework. The review
	concentrates on the mathematical conditions that allow the rigorous
	derivation of the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation matrix and
	its interesting physical properties. One of the findings of this
	study is that the non-adiabatic coupling terms have to be quantized
	in a certain manner in order to yield single-valued diabatic potentials.
	Another important feature revealed is the existence of the topological
	matrix, which contains all the topological features of a given molecular
	system related to a closed contour in configuration space. Finally,
	we present an approximation that results from the {Born--Oppenheimer}
	treatment which, in contrast to the original {Born--Oppenheimer}
	approximation, contains the effect of the non-adiabatic coupling
	terms. The various derivations are accompanied by examples which
	in many cases are interesting by themselves.},

  abstract = {Spinâorbit coupling (SOC) is an essential factor in photophysics of
	heavy transition metal complexes. By enabling efficient population
	of the lowest triplet state and its strong emission, it gives rise
	to a very interesting photophysical behavior and underlies photonic
	applications such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED) or luminescent
	imaging agents. \{SOC\} affects excited-state characters, relaxation
	dynamics, radiative and nonradiative decay pathways, as well as lifetimes
	and reactivity. We present a new photophysical model based on mixed-spin
	states, illustrated by relativistic spinâorbit \{TDDFT\} and MS-CASPT2
	calculations of [Re(imidazole)(CO)3(1,10-phenanthroline)]+. An excited-state
	scheme is constructed from spinâorbit (SO) states characterized by
	their energies, double-group symmetries, parentages in terms of contributing
	spin-free singlets and triplets, and oscillator strengths of corresponding
	transitions from the ground state. Some of the predictions of the
	relativistic \{SO\} model on the number and nature of the optically
	populated and intermediate excited states are qualitatively different
	from the spin-free model. The relativistic excited-state model accounts
	well for electronic absorption and emission spectra of ReI carbonyl
	diimines, as well as their complex photophysical behavior. Then,
	we discuss the \{SO\} aspects of photophysics of heavy metal complexes
	from a broader perspective. Qualitative \{SO\} models as well as
	previous relativistic excited-state calculations are briefly reviewed
	together with experimental manifestations of \{SOC\} in polypyridine
	and cyclometallated complexes of second- and third row d6 metals.
	It is shown that the relativistic \{SO\} model can provide a comprehensive
	and unifying photophysical picture.},

	with thiol containing ligands, (b) the stability constants for such
	systems and (c) the relative efficacy of 29 compounds as antidotes
	for mercury poisoning has been carried out to determine the structural
	requirements for Hg(II) antidotes. This leads to the suggestion that
	instances in which two thiol groups on the same chelate molecule
	are simultaneously bonded to the same Hg(II) species in a complex,
	water soluble or otherwise, are not found and Hg(II) species bearing
	two sulfur donors generally have a bond angle of 180 degree or so
	between these two bonds. It was hypothesized, from this, that chelating
	agents bearing a single sulfhydryl group might be almost as effective
	as mercury antidotes as those bearing two groups. Data on the stability
	constants and antidotal effectiveness are presented for such structures,
	but in general molecules which do not have the potential ability
	to chelate are also inferior as antidotes. From the data assembled
	it would appear that the presence of a second donor group is required.
	Because of the lability of the mercury-thiol bond, this second site
	seems necessary to provide the required kinetic stability for the
	complex. In the case of dithiols, the mercury may move back and forth
	from one sulfur donor site to another but may not (and possibily
	cannot) bind firmly and simultaneously to both donor sites. },

  abstract = {In this article, we compare and contrast the RASSCF, \{ONIOM\} and
	\{MMVB\} electronic structure methods for calculating relaxation
	paths on potential energy surfaces of the excited states of large
	molecules, and for locating any resulting conical intersections at
	which nonadiabatic decay can take place. Each method is treated here
	as an approximation to CASSCF, which we choose as our reference level
	of theory, but which becomes prohibitively expensive computationally
	for large molecules. Both \{MMVB\} and \{ONIOM\} are hybrid computational
	methods ? combining different levels of theory in an energy plus
	derivatives calculation at a particular molecular geometry ? but
	they differ fundamentally in that \{MMVB\} is a hybrid-atom method,
	whereas \{ONIOM\} is a hybrid-molecule method. We explain this distinction
	through four representative applications: the photostability of pyracylene
	(studied with CASSCF, RASSCF, MMVB); large geometry changes in the
	singlet excited states of triangulene (studied with MMVB); a model
	for interstitial nickel defects in a synthetic diamond lattice (studied
	with \{ONIOM\} CAS:UFF); and the photochemical [4&#xa0;+&#xa0;4]
	cycloaddition of cyclohexadiene to naphthalene (studied with \{ONIOM\}
	CAS:MMVB). We show that each method is more appropriate for a particular
	type of photochemical problem. This article is part perspective,
	part review, and contains new results for three multi-state or photoinduced
	processes in complex systems. },

  abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
	{(MCTDH)} method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	{MCTDH} may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with {MCTDH} to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all
	24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the {MCTDH} wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the {MCTDH}
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	{(CDVR)} method, is also briefly discussed.},

	its advantage over the conventional 'prior' and 'post' expansions
	which are shown to be special cases of IM S T. The practicality and
	usefulness of the theory is illustrated by its application to a number
	of current problems of atomic and molecular ionization in intense
	fields. We also present a consistent S -matrix formulation of the
	quantum amplitude for high harmonic generation (HHG) and point out
	some of the most general properties of HHG radiation emitted by a
	single atom as well as its relation to coherent emission from many
	atoms. Experimental results for single and double (multiple) ionization
	of atoms and the observed distributions of coincidence measurements
	are analysed and the dominant mechanisms behind them are discussed.
	Ionization of more complex systems such as diatomic and polyatomic
	molecules in intense laser fields is analysed as well using IM S
	T and the results are discussed with special attention to the role
	of molecular orbital symmetry and molecular orientation in space.

  abstract = {Skin is the largest body organ that serves as an important environmental
	interface providing a protective envelope that is crucial for homeostasis.
	On the other hand, the skin is a major target for toxic insult by
	a broad spectrum of physical (i.e. \{UV\} radiation) and chemical
	(xenobiotic) agents that are capable of altering its structure and
	function. Many environmental pollutants are either themselves oxidants
	or catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly
	or indirectly. \{ROS\} are believed to activate proliferative and
	cell survival signaling that can alter apoptotic pathways that may
	be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of skin disorders including
	photosensitivity diseases and some types of cutaneous malignancy.
	\{ROS\} act largely by driving several important molecular pathways
	that play important roles in diverse pathologic processes including
	ischemiaâreperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory responses.
	The skin possesses an array of defense mechanisms that interact with
	toxicants to obviate their deleterious effect. These include non-enzymatic
	and enzymatic molecules that function as potent antioxidants or oxidant-degrading
	systems. Unfortunately, these homeostatic defenses, although highly
	effective, have limited capacity and can be overwhelmed thereby leading
	to increased \{ROS\} in the skin that can foster the development
	of dermatological diseases. One approach to preventing or treating
	these ROS-mediated disorders is based on the administration of various
	antioxidants in an effort to restore homeostasis. Although many antioxidants
	have shown substantive efficacy in cell culture systems and in animal
	models of oxidant injury, unequivocal confirmation of their beneficial
	effects in human populations has proven elusive.},

	in steady-state and time-resolved experiments and theoretically by

	show that replacement of the C5 hydrogen of cytosine by fluorine
	increases the excited-state lifetime by 2 orders of magnitude from
	720 fs to 73 $\pm$ 4 ps. Experimental evidence indicates that emission
	in both compounds originates from a single tautomeric form. The lifetime
	of {5FC} is the same within experimental uncertainty in the solvents
	ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide. The insensitivity of the S1 lifetime
	to the protic nature of the solvent suggests that proton transfer
	is not the principal quenching mechanism for the excited state. Excited-state
	calculations were carried out for the amino-keto tautomer of {5FC},
	the dominant species in polar environments, in order to understand
	its longer excited-state lifetime. {CASSCF} and {CAS?PT2} calculations
	of the excited states show that the minimum energy path connecting
	the minimum of the $^1\pi\pi^*$ state with the conical intersection
	responsible for internal conversion has essentially the same energetics
	for cytosine and {5FC}, suggesting that both bases decay nonradiatively
	by the same mechanism. The dramatic difference in lifetimes may be
	due to subtle changes along the decay coordinate. A possible reason
	may be differences in the intramolecular vibrational redistribution
	rate from the {Franck?Condon} active, in-plane modes to the out-of-plane
	modes that must be activated to reach the conical intersection region.},

  abstract = {A three-state conical intersection between the ground state and the
	($\pi\pi^*$) and ($n_O\pi^*$) singlet excited states of cytosine
	is the topological feature that dominates the ultrafast decay of
	singlet excited cytosine. The three-state intersection is associated
	with seams of intersection between pairs of states ({S1/S0} and {S2/S1},
	respectively), and the resulting topology has been mapped out with
	{CASSCF} and {CAS-PT2} calculations. The minimum-energy path for
	the optically active ($\pi\pi^*$) state lies on the S1 surface, and
	decay to the ground state takes place at the {S1/S0} seam. On the
	other hand, the region of the {S2/S1} seam must be traversed before
	accessing the conical intersection with the ground state and recrossing
	to S2 becomes possible. Another feature associated with the three-state
	degeneracy is vibronic coupling between the ($\pi\pi^*$) and ($n_O\pi^*$)
	excited states (proximity effect), which lowers the barrier to the
	{S1/S0} seam. From a mechanistic point of view, then, the decay is
	the outcome of the interaction between the three states. The results
	also suggest that the experimental excited-state lifetime is the
	effect of two factors, an energetically accessible region of {S1/S0}
	degeneracy and a region where the decay can be slowed because of
	recrossing to S2.},

	analyzed as A-type transitions of a prolate asymmetric rotor, confirming
	that the electronic transition is {1B2} \$\leftarrow$ {1A1[2b1($\pi$*)}
	\$\leftarrow$ 1a2($\pi$)]. The electronic energy and rotational constants
	of the 0-0 band are, in cm-1: {T042573.450$\pm$0.005$\delta$J(0.041$\pm$0.05)10-5,A0001.15053$\pm$0.00014$\delta$JK(1.34$\pm$0.04)10-5,B0000.34744$\pm$0.00002$\delta$K(0.73$\pm$0.09)10-5,C0000.26543$\pm$0.00002$\delta$J(0.009$\pm$0.003)10-5,$\delta$(u\AA20.339$\pm$0.005$\delta$K(0.42$\pm$0.21)10-5}
	These constants correspond to the average structure r0 = 1.560 \AA
	and $\Theta$0 = 104.3$^\circ$. However, the vibrational structure
	can only be satisfactorily accounted for on the hypothesis of a double-minimum
	potential in the antisymmetrical stretching coordinate Q3, the energies
	of the fundamental levels in the three modes of the B2 state being:
	(100), 960 cm-1; (010), 377 cm-1; and (001), ~220 cm-1 The (001)
	level is not observed in the spectrum but can be calculated from
	the distortion constants and inertial defect of the rotational analysis:
	the level (002) = 561 cm-1, obtained directly from the vibrational
	structure, establishes that there is strong, positive anharmonicity
	in the first three levels of this vibration, as required by the assumption
	of a double-minimum potential function. Preliminary values are reported
	for the barrier to the symmetrical configuration, Vhc ~ 100 cm-1,
	and for the difference in bond distances in the equilibrium configuration,
	$\Delta$r$\simeq$0.12 \AA. Coon and his co-workers have previously
	considered the possible asymmetry of this state but the Q3 inversion
	barrier obtained by them, 656 cm-1, is much higher than in the present
	work, and reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = { The ability to visualize molecular structure in the course of a chemical
	reaction or a biological function has been a dream of scientists
	for decades. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is ideal in this
	respect because it is chemically selective and can be implemented
	in any type of medium. Furthermore, using X-ray absorption near-edge
	structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
	in laser pump/X-ray probe experiments allows the retrieval of not
	only the local geometric structure of the system under study, but

  year = {1978},
  volume = {12},
  pages = {197--226},
  number = {1--3},
  abstract = {An evaluation has been made of the existing kinetic data related to
	the elementary, homogeneous reactions of {SO2} within the troposphere.
	A set of preferred values of the rate constants for these reactions
	is presented. Simulations using these data provide significant new
	evidence that the oxidation of {SO2} can occur at substantial rates
	through these homogenous reaction paths. The direct photo-oxidation
	of {SO2} by way of the electronically excited states of {SO2} is
	relatively unimportant for most conditions which occur within the
	troposphere. The oxidation of {SO2} within the natural troposphere
	is expected to occur largely by way of reactions 39, 31 and 33, with
	reaction 39 being the dominant path: {HO} + {SO2} (+ M) {$\rightarrow$HOSO2}
	( + M) (39); {HO2} + {SO2} $\rightarrow$ {HO} + {SO3} (31); {CH3O2}
	+ {SO2$\rightarrow$CH3O} + {SO3} (33). By combining our kinetic estimates
	with the Crutzen and Fishman calculation of {[HO]}, {[HO2]} and {[CH3O2]}
	for the troposphere, we estimate that the total rates of {SO2} oxidation
	as high as 1.5\%h-1 are expected at midday in July in the midlatitudes.
	Theoretical estimates of the monthly rates averaged over the northern
	hemisphere vary from a low of 0.1 \%h-1 in January to a maximum of
	about 0.2\% h-1 in July. From our computer simulations of the reactions
	within an {SO2}, {NOx}, hydrocarbon, {CO}, aldehyde-polluted lower
	troposphere, it is predicted that the three reactions, 39. 31 and
	33 occur with about equal rates; {SO2} oxidations for this case can
	proceed homogeneously at rates as high as 4\% h-1. Considerations
	of the reactions in stack gas plumes suggest that a small maximum
	in the {SO2} photo-oxidation rate may occur during the early stages
	of the dispersion of a parcel of the stack gases into the air. This
	should be followed by a short period of slower oxidation. In theory
	the initial burst is expected to arise from {NO2} and {HONO} photolysis
	followed by reaction 39 and the reaction. O {(3P)} + {SO2} (+ M)$\rightarrow$
	{SO3} (+ M). After the extensive dilution of the stack gases by polluted
	urban air, the rate of {SO2} homogeneous oxidation is expected to
	approach that for a typical polluted urban atmosphere ({\textasciitilde}4\%h-1).},

  abstract = {Radiationless deactivation pathways of excited gas phase nucleobases
	were investigated using mass-selected femtosecond resolved pump-probe
	resonant ionization. By comparison between nucleobases and methylated
	species, in which tautomerism cannot occur, we can access intrinsic
	mechanisms at a time resolution never reported so far (80 fs). At
	this time resolution, and using appropriate substitution, real nuclear
	motion corresponding to active vibrational modes along deactivation
	coordinates can actually be probed. We provide evidence for the existence
	of a two-step decay mechanism, following a 267 nm excitation of the
	nucleobases. The time resolution achieved together with a careful
	zero time-delay calibration between lasers allow us to show that
	the first step does correspond to intrinsic dynamics rather than
	to a laser cross correlation. For adenine and 9-methyladenine a first
	decay component of about 100 fs has been measured. This first step
	is radically increased to 200 fs when the amino group hydrogen atoms
	of adenine are substituted by methyl groups. Our results could be
	rationalized according to the effect of the highly localized nature
	of the excitation combined to the presence of efficient deactivation
	pathway along both pyrimidine ring and amino group out-of-plane vibrational
	modes. These nuclear motions play a key role in the vibronic coupling
	between the initially excited $\pi\pi^*$ and the dark $n\pi^*$ states.
	This seems to be the common mechanism that opens up the earlier phase
	of the internal conversion pathway which then, in consideration of
	the rather fast relaxation times observed, would probably proceed
	via conical intersection between the $n\pi^*$ relay state and high
	vibrational levels of the ground state.},

  abstract = {Detailed theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that
	nearly complete electronic population inversion of molecular systems
	can be achieved with intense positively chirped broadband laser pulses.
	To provide a simple physical picture, a two-level model is used to
	examine the condition for the so-called $\pi$ pulses and a four-level
	model is designed to demonstrate for molecular systems the correlation
	between the sign of the chirp and the excited state population. The
	proposed molecular $\pi$ pulse is the combined result of vibrational
	coherence in the femtosecond regime and adiabatic inversion in the
	picosecond regime. Numerical results for a displaced oscillator,
	for {LiH} and for I2, show that the proposed molecular $\pi$ pulse
	scheme is robust with respect to changes in field parameters such
	as the linear positive chirp rate, field intensity, bandwidth, and
	carrier frequency, and is stable with respect to thermal and condensed
	phase conditions including molecular rotation, rovibronic coupling,
	and electronic dephasing. \copyright\ 2000 American Institute of

	In contrast to quantum wavepacket dynamics methods{,} it negates

	confine nuclear motion within a reduced number of vibrational modes.
	In addition{,} on-the-fly molecular dynamics techniques are easily
	combined with the atomistic description of the solvents (through
	the QM/MM approach) making it possible to explicitly address the

	using QM/MM Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH). We show that the decay
	of the initially excited singlet state into the lowest singlet (S1)
	state occurs within 100 fs{,} in agreement with previous experiments{,}
	and is slightly influenced by the solvent. Using a principal component
	analysis (PCA){,} we also identify the dominant normal modes activated

  abstract = {5Fluorouracil (5FU) is a radiosensitiser molecule routinely used in
	combined chemo- and radio-therapies to enhance and localize cancer
	treatments. We have employed ultra-short XUV pulses produced by high
	harmonic generation (HHG) as a pump pulse to study the dynamics underlying
	the photo-stability and the radiation damage of this molecule. This
	work shows that it is possible to resolve individual dynamics even
	when using unselected HH. By comparing the results with those obtained
	in the multiphoton absorption at 400 nm{,} we were able to identify
	the frequencies of the HH comb relevant to the recorded dynamics:
	HH5 and HH3. The latter excites a high-lying Rydberg state interacting
	with a valence state and its dynamics is revealed by a 30 fs decay
	signal in parent ion transient. Our results suggest that the same
	photoprotection mechanisms as those conferring photostability to
	the neutral nucleobases and to the DNA appear to be activated. HH5
	excites the molecule to a state around 10.5 eV that undergoes an
	ultrafast relaxation on a timescale of 30 fs due nonadiabatic interactions.
	This is followed sequentially by 2.3 ps internal conversion as revealed
	by the dynamics observed for another fragment ion. These dynamics
	are extracted from the fragment ion signals. Proton or hydrogen transfer
	processes are required for the formation of three fragments and we
	speculate that the time scale of one of the processes is revealed
	by H+ transient signal.},

  abstract = { The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced
	by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s is based on the idea
	that the complicated N-electron wave function can be replaced with
	the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic
	structure calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary
	DFT cannot treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited
	electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making
	TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states
	may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR)
	theory formalism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly
	popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and
	large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy
	has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application.
	As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT have grown,
	so too has our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the
	approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of
	this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in
	Volume 55 of the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry left off and
	highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view
	of applied physical chemistry. Because doubly-excited states have
	a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation
	in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis is placed
	on the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation,
	which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states.

  abstract = {This paper presents a density functional theory study of the ruthenium-catalyzed
	olefin metathesis reactions. The ligand binding energy has been calculated
	in the first generation of Grubbs-type ({PCy3)2Cl2RuCHPh} (pre)catalyst,
	as well as in the heteroleptic (pre)catalytic systems in which a
	N-heterocyclic carbene, {NHC}, ligand substitutes a single phosphine.
	In agreement with experiments {PCy3} coordinates more strongly to
	Ru in the heteroleptic (pre)catalysts than in the Grubbs-type (pre)catalyst.
	Moreover, ethene coordination and insertion into the Ru?alkylidene
	bond in the above-mentioned systems, as well as in the Hofmann type
	catalytic system with a cis-coordinated phosphane ligand, has been
	studied. The calculated insertion barrier for the {NHC} systems are
	lower than that of the ({PCy3)2Cl2RuCHPh} system. This is consistent
	with the higher activity experimentally observed for the {NHC-based}
	system.},

	(2) and 5-bromo-2?-deoxycytidine (3) with N?-acetyl-l-tryptophan
	N-ethylamide (4) in aqueous buffered (pH 7) solutions were studied.
	These photoreactions led to N?-acetyl-2-(cytosin-5-yl)tryptophan
	N-ethylamide (1a), N?-acetyl-2-(1-methylcytosin-5-yl)tryptophan N-ethylamide
	(2a) and N?-acetyl-2-[1-(2-deoxy-?-l-erythro-pentofuranosyl)cytosin-5-yl]trypophan
	N-ethylamide (3a) respectively as the main photoproducts. Thus the
	coupling observed was regiospecific between the 5 position of cytosine
	and the 2 position of the indole ring of 4. The structure of the
	photoproducts was established by spectroscopic methods (1H and 13C
	nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, \{UV\} spectroscopy,
	electron impact and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry); in the
	case of 1a, additional confirmatory evidence was obtained by a chemical
	method (the diazotization reaction of 1a with sodium nitrite and
	acetic acid to give N?-acetyl-2-(uracil-5-yl)tryptophanN-ethylamide).
	The quantum yields of formation of the cytosine-tryptophan adducts
	1a?3a ranged from 3.9 x 10?3 to 5.4 x 10?3. The formation of cross-links
	of the type proposed here between 5-bromocytosine-substituted \{DNA\}
	and proteins may be detected by the characteristic fluorescence emission
	of the cytosine-tryptophan fluorophore. The mechanism of formation
	of the photoproducts 1a?3a is proposed to involve electrophilic attack
	of the 5-cytosinyl cation on the indole ring of 4. },

	anion (dGMP-) are very similar to those of the adenosine nucleotide
	(dAMP-) and are insensitive to solvent. Comparison of our results
	with other literature suggests that nucleotides of the two purine
	bases share a common relaxation pathway{,} whereby the initially
	populated 1[small pi][small pi]* states relax to the ground electronic
	state without involvement of any other intermediary electronic states.
	In the analogous pyrimidine nucleotides of thymine and cytosine{,}
	dTMP- and dCMP-{,} no such unified mechanism is observed. Photoexcited
	dTMP- behaves much like the isolated nucleobase thymine{,} exhibiting
	rapid relaxation to the ground electronic state{,} although with
	a minor long-lived channel. On the other hand{,} isolated dCMP- is
	longer lived than its cytosine nucleobase{,} and hence it appears
	that the presence of the sugar and phosphate in the nucleotide arrangement
	leads to a modification of the available relaxation pathways. Nucleotides
	are the basic monomer building blocks of DNA and our results present
	important new benchmark data to develop an understanding of the molecular
	mechanism by which photodamage can be mediated when DNA is exposed

  abstract = {Background: Gene silencing by abnormal methylation of promoter regions
	of regulatory genes is commonly associated with cancer. Silenced
	tumor suppressor genes are obvious targets for reactivation by methylation
	inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine (5-Aza-CR) and 5-aza-2?-deoxycytidine
	(5-Aza-CdR). However, both compounds are chemically unstable and
	toxic and neither can be given orally. We characterized a new demethylating
	agent, zebularine [1-(beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one],
	which is a chemically stable cytidine analog. Methods: We tested
	the ability of zebularine to reactivate a silenced Neurospora crassa
	gene using a hygromycin gene reactivation assay. We then analyzed
	the ability of zebularine to inhibit DNA methylation in C3H 10T1/2
	Cl8 (10T1/2) mouse embryo cells as assayed by induction of a myogenic
	phenotype and in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells, using the methylation-sensitive
	single nucleotide primer extension (Ms-SNuPE) assay. We also evaluated
	the effects of zebularine (administered orally or intraperitoneally)
	on growth of EJ6 human bladder carcinoma cells grown in BALB/c nu/nu
	mice (five mice per group) and the in vivo reactivation of a methylated
	p16 gene in these cells. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results:
	In N. crassa, zebularine inhibited DNA methylation and reactivated
	a gene previously silenced by methylation. Zebularine induced the
	myogenic phenotype in 10T1/2 cells, which is a phenomenon unique
	to DNA methylation inhibitors. Zebularine reactivated a silenced
	p16 gene and demethylated its promoter region in T24 bladder carcinoma
	cells in vitro and in tumors grown in mice. Zebularine was only slightly
	cytotoxic to T24 cells in vitro (1 mM zebularine for 48 hours decreased
	plating efficiency by 17% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.8% to
	21.2%]) and to tumor-bearing mice (average maximal weight change
	in mice treated with 1000 mg/kg zebularine = 11% [95% CI = 4% to
	19%]). Compared with those in control mice, tumor volumes were statistically
	significantly reduced in mice treated with high-dose zebularine administered
	by intraperitoneal injection (P<.001) or by oral gavage (P<.001).
	Conclusions: Zebularine is a stable DNA demethylating agent and the
	first drug in its class able to reactivate an epigenetically silenced
	gene by oral administration.},

  pages = {638-655},
  abstract = {One goal of this critical review is to provide advanced methodologies
	for systematic preparation of transition-metal based phosphors that
	show latent applications in the field of organic light emitting diodes
	(OLEDs). We are therefore reviewing various types of cyclometalating
	chelates for which the favorable metal-chelate bonding interaction{,}
	on the one hand{,} makes the resulting phosphorescent complexes highly
	emissive in both fluid and solid states at room temperature. On the
	other hand{,} fine adjustment of ligand-centered [small pi]-[small
	pi]* electronic transitions allows tuning of emission wavelength
	across the whole visible spectrum. The cyclometalating chelates are
	then classified according to types of cyclometalating groups{,} i.e.
	either aromatic C-H or azolic N-H fragment{,} and the adjacent donor
	fragment involved in the formation of metallacycles; the latter is
	an N-containing heterocycle{,} N-heterocyclic (NHC) carbene fragment
	or even diphenylphosphino group. These cyclometalating ligands are
	capable to react with heavy transition-metal elements{,} namely:
	Ru(ii){,} Os(ii){,} Ir(iii) and Pt(ii){,} to afford a variety of
	highly emissive phosphors{,} for which the photophysical properties
	as a function of chelate or metal characteristics are systematically
	discussed. Using Ir(iii) complexes as examples{,} the C^N chelates
	possessing both C-H site and N-heterocyclic donor group are essential
	for obtaining phosphors with emission ranging from sky-blue to saturated
	red{,} while the N^N chelates such as 2-pyridyl-C-linked azolates
	are found useful for serving as true-blue chromophores due to their
	increased ligand-centered [small pi]-[small pi]* energy gap. Lastly{,}
	the remaining NHC carbene and benzyl phosphine chelates are highly
	desirable to serve as ancillary chelates in localizing the electronic
	transition between the metal and remaining lower energy chromophoric
	chelates. As for the potential opto-electronic applications{,} many
	of them exhibit remarkable performance data{,} which are convincing
	to pave a broad avenue for further development of all types of phosphorescent
	displays and illumination devices (94 references).},

  abstract = {We present for the first time an exact quantum study of spin--orbit-induced
	intersystem crossing effects in the title reaction. The time-dependent
	wave-packet method, combined with an extended split operator scheme,
	is used to calculate the fine-structure resolved cross section. The
	calculation involves four electronic potential-energy surfaces of
	the state [ J. Dobbyn and P. J. Knowles, Faraday Discuss. 110, 247
	(1998)] , the and the two degenerate states [ S. Rogers, D. Wang,
	A. Kuppermann, and S. Wald, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 2308 (2000)] ,
	and the spin--orbit couplings between them [ B. Maiti, and G. C.
	Schatz, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 12360 (2003)] . Our quantum dynamics
	calculations clearly demonstrate that the spin--orbit coupling between
	the triplet states of different symmetries has the greatest contribution
	to the intersystem crossing, whereas the singlet-triplet coupling
	is not an important effect. A branch ratio of the spin state $\Pi$3/2
	to $\Pi$1/2 of the product {OH} was calculated to be ~ 2.75, with
	collision energy higher than 0.6 {eV}, when the wave packet was initially
	on the triplet surfaces. The quantum calculation agrees quantitatively
	with the previous quasiclassical trajectory surface hopping study.},

  abstract = {Development of functional inorganic and transition metal compounds
	is usually based on ad hoc qualified guesses, with computational
	methods playing a lesser role than in drug discovery. A de novo evolutionary
	algorithm ({EA)} is presented that automatically generates transition
	metal complexes using a search space constrained around chemically
	meaningful structures assembled from three kinds of fragments: a
	part shared by all structures and typically containing the metal
	center itself, one or several parts consisting of ligand skeletons,
	and unconstrained parts that may grow and vary freely. In {EA} optimizations,
	using a cost-efficient fitness function based on a linear quantitative
	structure?activity relationship model for catalytic activity, we
	demonstrate the capabilities of the method by retracing the transition
	from the first-generation, phosphine-based Grubbs olefin metathesis
	catalysts to second-generation catalysts containing N-heterocyclic
	carbene ligands instead of phosphines. Moreover, {DFT} calculations
	on selected high-fitness, last-generation structures from these evolutionary
	experiments suggest that, in terms of catalytic activity, the structures
	arrived at by virtual evolution alone compare favorably with existing,
	highly active catalysts. The structures from the evolution experiments
	are, however, complex and probably difficult to synthesize, but a
	set of manually simplified variations thereof might form the leads
	for a new generation of Grubbs catalysts.},

  abstract = {Thiopurine antimetabolites, such as azathioprine (Aza) and 6-thioguanine
	(6-TG), are widely used in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory
	conditions and organ transplantation patients. Recent work has shown
	that cells treated with 6-TG and \{UVA\} generate ROS, with implied
	oxidatively generated modification of DNA. In a study of urinary
	8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â²-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in renal transplant
	patients, we provided the first in vivo evidence linking Aza and
	oxidatively damaged DNA. Using the hOGG1 comet assay, we herein demonstrate
	high levels of 8-oxodG and alkali-labile sites (ALS) in cells treated
	with biologically relevant doses of 6-TG, or Aza, plus UVA. This
	damage was induced dose-dependently. Surprisingly, given the involvement
	of 6-TG incorporation into \{DNA\} in its therapeutic effect, significant
	amounts of 8-oxodG and \{ALS\} were induced in quiescent cells, although
	less than in proliferating cells. We speculate that some activity
	of hOGG1 towards unirradiated, 6-TG treated cells, implies possible
	recognition of 6-TG or derivatives thereof. This is the first report
	to conclusively demonstrate oxidatively damaged \{DNA\} in cells
	treated with thiopurines and UVA. These data indicate that Aza-derived
	oxidative stress will occur in the skin of patients on Aza, following
	even low level \{UVA\} exposure. This is a probable contributor to
	the increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in these patients.
	However, as oxidative stress is unlikely to be involved in the therapeutic
	effects of Aza, intercepting \{ROS\} production in the skin could
	be a viable route by which this side effect may be minimised. },

	The concentration of gaseous {SO2} and of sulphur-containing aerosol
	was monitored both in the dark and in sunlight using radioactive
	{35SO2} and the rate of photochemical reaction was determined from
	the decay of {SO2} and the yield of aerosol. Following other workers,
	we believe that the sulphur containing aerosol formed consists of
	sulphuric acid droplets. The aerosol measurements gave a photochemical
	conversion rate of {SO2} of up to 0.65 per cent per hour and values
	at least as high as this may be expected in the atmosphere. High
	conversion rates determined from the decay of {SO2} (up to 100 per
	cent per hour) are believed to be unrealistic due to a reaction on
	the chamber walls.
	
	The observed conversion rates from the aerosol measurements were considerably
	higher than the widely accepted value of 0.1 per cent per hour. It
	is suggested that the participation in the photochemical reaction
	of trace impurities in the ambient air may account for this.},

  abstract = {Solar ultraviolet light creates excited electronic states in {DNA}
	that can decay to mutagenic photoproducts. This vulnerability is
	compensated for in all organisms by enzymatic repair of photodamaged
	{DNA.} As repair is energetically costly, {DNA} is intrinsically
	photostable. Single bases eliminate electronic energy non-radiatively
	on a subpicosecond timescale, but base stacking and base pairing
	mediate the decay of excess electronic energy in the double helix
	in poorly understood ways. In the past, considerable attention has
	been paid to excited base pairs. Recent reports have suggested that
	light-triggered motion of a proton in one of the hydrogen bonds of
	an isolated base pair initiates non-radiative decay to the electronic
	ground state. Here we show that vertical base stacking, and not base
	pairing, determines the fate of excited singlet electronic states
	in single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of adenine
	(A) and thymine (T) bases. Intrastrand excimer states with lifetimes
	of 50-150 ps are formed in high yields whenever A is stacked with
	itself or with T. Excimers limit excitation energy to one strand
	at a time in the B-form double helix, enabling repair using the undamaged
	strand as a template.},

	theoretical description of ultra-short time delays and to relate
	these to the phase of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and
	to the asymptotic phaseshifts of photoelectron wave packets. Special
	emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments, where attosecond XUV
	pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at well-defined times,
	followed by a probing process in real time by a phase-locked, infrared
	laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a 'clock' to
	monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not correspond
	directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization. Instead,
	a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement
	induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics.
	This artefact is traced back to a phaseshift of the above-threshold
	ionization transition matrix element, which we call the continuum--continuum
	phase . It arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between
	Coulomb continuum states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced
	effects can be separated from the single-photon ionization process,
	using analytical expressions of universal character, so that eventually
	the attosecond time delays in photoionization can be accessed.},

	form, is analyzed in this paper. Particular attention is given to
	the quadratically convergent methods. Orbital variations are generated
	by unitary transformations and an expansion of the total energy through
	second order in the parameters used to define these transformations
	provides a characterization of the stationary point, which is reached
	at convergence, as well as estimates of second order properties.
	Effective one-particle potentials are analyzed and it is emphasized
	that only certain blocks of the Fock matrix are determined by the
	generalized Brillouin theorem. In an analysis of the convergence
	properties of the various methods it is shown that the {Hartree--Fock}
	procedure can be brought to converge for stable states of a given
	symmetry if the blocks of the Fock matrix, which are not determined
	by the Brillouin theorem, are chosen in an appropriate fashion. The
	procedures, which we discuss, are finally compared to currently employed
	techniques including direct energy optimization procedures, energy
	weighted steepest descent methods and generalizations of Roothaans
	equations.},

	optimization by direct inversion in the iterative subspace extrapolation
	is used to improve the convergence properties of the corresponding

	the crossing between the 1 {1B1/2} {1A1} valence states in formaldehyde,
	the crossing between the 2 {1A1/3} {1A1} $\pi$-$\pi$* valence and
	ny-3py Rydberg states in formaldehyde, and three crossings in the
	case of the photodimerization of ethylene. The methods developed

	M06-L) have been performed to investigate the mechanism and origins
	of Z selectivity of the metathesis homodimerization of terminal olefins
	catalyzed by chelated ruthenium complexes. The chosen system is,
	without any simplification, the experimentally performed homocoupling
	reaction of 3-phenyl-1-propene with 1cat, a pivalate and N-heterocyclic
	carbene ({NHC)} chelated Ru precatalyst. The six-coordinate 1cat
	converts to a trigonal-bipyramidal intermediate (3) through initial
	dissociation and isomerization. The metathesis reaction of complex
	3 with 3-phenyl-1-propene occurs in a side-bound mechanism and generates
	the trigonal-bipyramidal Ru?benzylidene complex 6. Complex 6 is the
	active catalyst for the subsequent side-bound metathesis with 3-phenyl-1-propene,
	which forms metallacyclobutanes that lead to the (Z)- and (E)-olefin
	homodimers. The transition states of cycloreversion leading to the
	(Z)- and (E)-olefins differ in energy by 2.2 kcal/mol, which gives
	rise to a calculated Z selectivity that agrees with experimental
	results. The Z selectivity stems from reduced steric repulsion in
	the transition state. The regeneration of complex 6 occurs along
	with the formation of the gaseous byproduct ethylene, whose evolution
	drives the overall reaction. As our results indicate, the chelating
	ligands are crucial for this new class of Ru catalysts to achieve
	Z-selective olefin metathesis, because they direct olefin attack,
	differentiate energies of the transition states and intermediates,
	and support the complexes in certain coordination geometries.},

  abstract = {The current armamentarium for the chemotherapy of viral infections
	consists of 37 licensed antiviral drugs. For the treatment of human
	immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, 19 compounds have been formally
	approved: (i) the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
	zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir
	and emtricitabine; (ii) the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor
	(NtRTI) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; (iii) the non-nucleoside reverse
	transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz;
	(iv) the protease inhibitors saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir,
	amprenavir, lopinavir (combined with ritonavir at a 4/1 ratio) and
	atazanavir; and the viral entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. For the treatment
	of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, lamivudine as well
	as adefovir dipivoxil have been approved. Among the anti-herpesvirus
	agents, acyclovir, valaciclovir, penciclovir (when applied topically),
	famciclovir, idoxuridine and trifluridine (both applied topically)
	as well as brivudin are used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus
	(HSV) and/or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections; and ganciclovir,
	valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and fomivirsen (the latter upon
	intravitreal injection) have proven useful in the treatment of cytomegalovirus
	(CMV) infections in immunosuppressed patients (i.e. \{AIDS\} patients
	with \{CMV\} retinitis). Following amantadine and rimantadine, the
	neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir have recently
	become available for the therapy (and prophylaxis) of influenza virus
	infections. Ribavirin has been used (topically, as aerosol) in the
	treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, and the
	combination of ribavirin with (pegylated) interferon-alpha has received
	increased acceptance for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
	infections. },

  abstract = {We performed a comparative theoretical study of the relaxation mechanisms
	of the excited states of uracil and 4-pyrimidinone with the CASSCF{,}
	CASPT2{,} and CC2 ab initio methods. The calculated vertical excitation
	energies agree with the experimental UV absorption maxima of the
	two compounds. Three low-lying conical intersections between the
	S0 and S1 states (one for uracil{,} two for 4-pyrimidinone) are established.
	They are accessible from the Franck-Condon region of the 1[small
	pi][small pi]* state through out-of-plane deformations related to
	C[double bond{,} length as m-dash]C (for uracil) or C[double bond{,}
	length as m-dash]N (for 4-pyrimidinone) torsions of the heterocyclic
	ring. These conical intersections mediate the radiationless deactivation
	of the compounds after excitation of the lowest 1[small pi][small
	pi]* state. The relaxation of the 1[small pi][small pi]* state of
	4-pyrimidinone via C[double bond{,} length as m-dash]C twisting is
	hindered by a barrier. The relaxed scan of the C[double bond{,} length
	as m-dash]N double-bond twisting of 4-pyrimidinone indicates that
	the formation of the Dewar form may represent a photochemical channel
	in 4-pyrimidinone. This fact is detrimental for the photostability
	of 4-pyrimidinone{,} since the Dewar form is separated by a high
	potential-energy barrier from the canonical form of 4-pyrimidinone
	on the ground-state potential-energy surface{,} which prevents a
	thermal back-reaction. The investigation of the vertical excitation
	energies and the reaction paths shows that 4-pyrimidinone is less
	photostable than uracil.},

  abstract = {The absorption spectrum of cytosine in water has been studied by combining
	{Car?Parrinello} molecular dynamics ({MD)} with a multiconfigurational
	perturbation theory treatment of the electronic structure. The {MD}
	simulations were performed for four different tautomeric forms of
	cytosine in a unit cell with 60 water molecules. The relative energies
	and transition dipole moments of a large number of excited states
	have been calculated on a representative sample of conformations
	along the {MD} trajectories. In this way, the broad experimental
	peaks can be decomposed, and the effect of the distortions on the
	nature of the excited states can be assessed. The loss of planarity
	of the molecule is significant, and hence, the excited states can
	no longer be defined as pure $n\pi^*$ or $\pi\pi^*$ excitations.
	We propose an analysis to assign the different transitions according
	to the main contribution. The keto {N1H} form turns out to be the
	most stable one, and the calculated spectra of this tautomer show
	good agreement with experimental measurements. The mixed $n\pi^*$/$\pi\pi^*$
	character of some states leads to a significant increase of intensity
	in spectral regions dominated by the dark $n\pi^*$ transitions considering
	a planar structure.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations
	have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently,
	Alml\"of, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural
	orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations {(ANOs)} provide
	an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report
	here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing
	that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and
	efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the
	functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although
	the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can
	be taken from atomic {Hartree--Fock} calculations if the appropriate
	primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules
	indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation
	effects as well as the {ANO} sets of Alml\"of and Taylor. Guided
	by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic
	and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row
	atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen
	atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings
	due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups.
	This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e.,
	sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all
	functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given
	for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined
	in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation
	energy obtained with the corresponding {ANO} sets, even though the
	latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive
	polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%--97\%
	of the total {(HF+1+2)} correlation energy for the atoms neon through
	boron.},

	and are converted into the ribonucleotides 6-thioguanosine monophosphate
	(6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) respectively.
	The accumulation of these monophosphates inhibits several vital metabolic
	reactions. Today, these thiopurine bases remain valuable agents for
	the induction and maintenance of remissions in patients with myelocytic
	and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Despite their proved clinical importance,
	6MP and 6TG have certain therapeutic disadvantages, which have continued
	to stimulate the search for purine derivatives enhancing therapeutic
	efficacy. Considerable efforts have been made to prepare other novel
	mercaptopurine and thioguanine analogs and their nucleosides to improve
	the antitumor efficacy. The effectiveness of these thiopurines against
	certain tumor cell lines suggested that some of these mercaptopurine

	neoplastic cells than against normal cells or they might be useful
	in patients whose disease has become resistant to 6MP or 6TG. This
	review will focus on mercaptopurine analogs and their nucleosides

  abstract = {The matrix elements of the spin--orbit operator between the zero-order
	(spin-free) (n, $\pi$*) states of nitrogen heterocyclics are examined.
	It is found that generally, to the first order, there is no spin--orbit
	coupling between singlet and triplet states of the same configuration.
	The coupling between states of different configurations due to differences
	in the occupancy of the $\pi$* orbitals, but having the same nonbonding
	orbital, is found to have matrix elements similar to those resulting
	from the coupling between ($\pi$, $\pi$*) states, which {McClure}
	has shown to be unimportant. For the diazines (or polyazines), the
	coupling between different configurations due to a different occupancy
	of the nonbonding orbitals is found to have matrix elements which
	cancel one another. The general conclusion is thus reached that spin--orbit
	(s.o.) coupling between singlet and triplet (n, $\pi$*) states is
	unimportant to the first order. Using the observed polarization and
	lifetime data, it is estimated that the ratiohas an upper value of
	10--3. These results as well as vibrational overlap considerations
	suggest that the enhancement of the efficiency of the intersystem
	crossing in nitrogen heterocyclics with the lowest singlet state
	of the (n, $\pi$*) type might be due to an S(n, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T($\pi$},
	$\pi$*) rather than an S(n, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T(n}, $\pi$*) radiationless
	process. An alternative explanation to the one previously given for
	the observation of fluorescence of 9, 10-diazaphenanthrene and s-tetrazine
	is thus suggested. In these molecules, the strong interaction between
	the (n, $\pi$*) singlet levels might cause the lowest S(n, $\pi$*)
	excited level to have a lower energy value than the ($\pi$, $\pi$*)
	triplet level. This would therefore lead to a retardation of the
	intersystem crossing process and allow the fluorescence to be observed.
	The characteristics of the observed weak phosphorescence of 9,10-diazaphenanthrene
	give spectroscopic support for this {proposal.For} nitrogen heterocyclic
	molecules with the lowest singlet and lowest triplet states of the
	($\pi$, $\pi$*) types, an examination of the quinoline total emission
	in comparison with that of the parent hydrocarbon, nath-thalene,
	suggests an increase in the efficiency of the intersystem crossing
	process in quinoline. This is suggested to be due to the efficient
	S1($\pi$, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T2(n}, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T1($\pi$},
	$\pi$*) radiationless process. A probable enhancement of the internal
	conversion processes in these molecules is suggested to be due to
	an increase in the density of states and the efficiency of the S($\pi$,
	{$\pi$*)$\leftrightarrow$S(n}, $\pi$*) radiationless process due
	to a large vibrational overlap integral.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a unified treatment of non-radiative decay
	processes in large molecules which involve either electronic relaxation
	between two electronic states or unimolecular rearrangement reactions
	in excited electronic states. The present treatment is analogous
	to the formalism previously applied for the line shape problem in
	nuclear recoil and in the optical spectra of solids. We were able
	to derive theoretical expressions for the non-radiative decay probability
	so that an arbitrary number of different molecular vibrations can
	be incorporated in the vibrational overlap factors. The general expressions
	obtained herein can be reduced to analytical form for two limiting
	cases, which we call the strong coupling case (which corresponds
	to a substantial horizontal displacement of the potential energy
	surfaces of the two electronic states) and the weak coupling limit
	(whereupon the relative horizontal displacement of the two potential
	energy surfaces is small). Quantitative criteria for the applicability
	of these two coupling limits are provided. In the strong coupling
	limit the transition probability is determined by a gaussian function
	of the energy parameter {(?E} - {EM} ), where {?E} is the energy
	gap between the origins of the two electronic states and {2EM} is
	the Stokes shift. This limit exhibits a generalized Arrhenius type
	temperature behaviour whereupon the transition probability depends
	exponentially on the energy barrier for the intersection of the two
	potential surfaces. At low temperatures the transition probability
	is determined by the mean vibrational frequency and is thus expected
	to reveal only a moderately weak deuterium isotope effect. The weak
	coupling limit reveals an exponential (or rather superexponential)
	dependence of the transition probability on the energy gap {?E.}
	In this limit the transition probability is dominated by the highest
	vibrational frequency (e.g. the {C-H} or {C-D} vibrations) and thus
	will reveal a marked isotope effect. When semi-empirical estimates
	of the pre-exponential factors are provided, the approximate theoretical
	expression for the weak coupling limit is found to be consistent
	with the available experimental data on electronic relaxation in
	large organic molecules.},

	The direct S1 [rightward arrow] T1 intersystem crossing (ISC) accounts

	T2 or higher triplets. The nonadiabatic transitions within the triplet

	about 3/4 of the total triplet population{,} and that of the other

	active immediately after n [rightward arrow] [small pi]* excitation:
	one is the C[double bond{,} length as m-dash]O stretching and the

  abstract = {In the past few years thionucleobases have been extensively used as
	intrinsic photolabels to probe the structure in solution of folded
	\{RNA\} molecules and to identify contacts within nucleic acids and/or
	between nucleic acids and proteins, in complex nucleoprotein assemblies.
	These thio residues such as 4-thiouracil found in E. coli tRNA and
	its non-natural congeners 4-thiothymine, 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine
	absorb light at wavelengths longer than 320 nm and, thus, can be
	selectively photoactivated. Synthetic or enzymatic procedures have
	been established, allowing the random or site-specific incorporation
	of thionucleotide(s) within a \{RNA\} (DNA) chain which, in most
	cases, retains unaltered structural and biological properties. Owing
	to the high photoreactivity of their triplet state (intersystem yield
	close to unity). 4-thiouracil and 4-thiothymine derivatives exhibit
	a high photocrosslinking ability towards pyrimidines (particularly
	thymine) but also purines. From the nature of the photoproducts obtained
	in base or nucleotide mixtures and in dinucleotides, the main photochemical
	pathway was identified as a (2 + 2) photoaddition of the excited
	C-S bond onto the 5, 6 double bond of pyrimidines yielding thietane
	intermediates whose structure could be characterized. Depending on
	the mutual orientation of these bonds in the thietanes, their subsequent
	dark rearrangement yielded, respectively, either the 5-4 or 6-4 bipyrimidine
	photoadduct. A similar mechanism appears to be involved in the formation
	of the unique photoadduct formed between 4-thiothymidine and adenosine.
	The higher reactivity of thymine derived acceptors can be explained
	by an additional pathway which involves hydrogen abstraction from
	the thymine methyl group, followed by radical recombination, leading
	to methylne linked bipyrimidines. The high photocrosslinking potential
	of thionucleosides inserted in nucleic acid chains has been used
	to probe RNA-RNA contacts within the ribosome permitting, in particular,
	the elucidation of the path of mRNA throughout the small ribosomal
	subunit. Functional interactions between the mRNA spliced sites and
	U \{RNAs\} could be detected within the spliceosome. Analysis of
	the photocrosslinks obtained within small endonucleolytic ribozymes
	in solution led to a tertiary folded pseudo-knot structure for the
	\{HDV\} ribozyme and allowed the construction of a Y form of a hammerhead
	ribozyme, which revealed to be in close agreement with the structure
	observed in crystals. Thionucleosides incorporated in nucleic acids
	crosslink efficiently aminoacid residues of proteins in contact with
	them. Despite the fact that little is known about the nature of the
	photoadducts formed, this approach has been extensively used to identify
	protein components interacting at a defined nucleic acid site and
	applied to various systems (replisome, spliceosome, transcription
	complexes and ribosomes). },

	syndromes provide no survival advantage. In this trial, we aimed
	to assess the effect of azacitidine on overall survival compared
	with the three commonest conventional care regimens. Methods In a
	phase III, international, multicentre, controlled, parallel-group,
	open-label trial, patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
	were randomly assigned one-to-one to receive azacitidine (75 mg/m2
	per day for 7 days every 28 days) or conventional care (best supportive
	care, low-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy as selected
	by investigators before randomisation). Patients were stratified
	by FrenchâAmericanâBritish and international prognostic scoring system
	classifications; randomisation was done with a block size of four.
	The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were
	by intention to treat for all patients assigned to receive treatment.
	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00071799.
	Findings Between Feb 13, 2004, and Aug 7, 2006, 358 patients were
	randomly assigned to receive azacitidine (n=179) or conventional
	care regimens (n=179). Four patients in the azacitidine and 14 in
	the conventional care groups received no study drugs but were included
	in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. After a median follow-up
	of 21Â·1 months (IQR 15Â·1â26Â·9), median overall survival was 24Â·5
	months (9Â·9ânot reached) for the azacitidine group versus 15Â·0 months
	(5Â·6â24Â·1) for the conventional care group (hazard ratio 0Â·58; 95%
	\{CI\} 0Â·43â0Â·77; stratified log-rank p=0Â·0001). At last follow-up,
	82 patients in the azacitidine group had died compared with 113 in
	the conventional care group. At 2 years, on the basis of Kaplan-Meier
	estimates, 50Â·8% (95% \{CI\} 42Â·1â58Â·8) of patients in the azacitidine
	group were alive compared with 26Â·2% (18Â·7â34Â·3) in the conventional
	care group (p&lt;0Â·0001). Peripheral cytopenias were the most common
	grade 3â4 adverse events for all treatments. Interpretation Treatment
	with azacitidine increases overall survival in patients with higher-risk
	myelodysplastic syndromes relative to conventional care. Funding

	representation of the electronic density. Nearly linear scaling for
	building the total Fock matrix is demonstrated for systems of intermediate

	When applied to excited states, a small shift merely moves the singularity.
	A large shift may cause new divergencies, and too large shifts are
	unacceptable since the potential function is affected in regions
	further away from the singularities. This Letter presents an alternative
	which may be regarded as an imaginary shift. The singularities are
	not moved, but disappear completely. They are replaced by a small
	distortion of the potential function. Applications to the \{N2\}
	ground state, its A3/gEu+ state, and the Cr2 ground state show that
	the distortion caused by this procedure is small. },

  abstract = {The {UV} components of sunlight are believed to be a major cause of
	human skin cancer, and {DNA} is thought to be the principal molecular
	target. Alterations of the intensity and wavelength distribution
	of solar {UV} radiation reaching the surface of the earth, for example

	of solar radiation in damaging {DNA} in human skin. Evaluation of
	the magnitude of such effects requires knowledge of the altered sunlight
	spectrum and of the action spectrum for damaging {DNA} in human skin.
	We have determined an action spectrum for the frequency of pyrimidine
	dimer formation induced in the {DNA} of human skin per unit dose
	of {UV} incident on the skin surface. The peak of this action spectrum
	is near 300 nm and decreases rapidly at both longer and shorter wavelengths.
	The decrease in our action spectrum for wavelengths less than 300
	nm is attributed to the absorption of the upper layers of the skin,
	an in situ effect that is inherently included in our measurements.
	Convolution of the dimer action spectrum with the solar spectra corresponding
	to a solar angle of 40 degrees under current levels of stratospheric
	ozone (0.32-cm O3 layer) and those for 50\% ozone depletion (0.16-cm
	O3 layer), indicate about a 2.5-fold increase in dimer formation.
	If the action spectrum for {DNA} damage that results in skin cancer
	resembles that for dimer induction in skin, our results, combined
	with epidemiological data, suggest that a 50\% decrease in stratospheric
	ozone would increase the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers among
	white males in Seattle, Washington, by 7.5- to 8-fold, to a higher
	incidence than is presently seen in the corresponding population
	of Albuquerque, New Mexico.},

  abstract = {The O(3P) + C2H4 reaction, of importance in combustion and atmospheric
	chemistry, stands out as a paradigm reaction involving triplet- and
	singlet-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) interconnected by
	intersystem crossing (ISC). This reaction poses challenges for theory
	and experiments owing to the ruggedness and high dimensionality of
	these potentials, as well as the long lifetimes of the collision
	complexes. Primary products from five competing channels (H + CH2CHO,
	H + CH3CO, H2 + CH2CO, CH3 + HCO, CH2 + CH2O) and branching ratios
	(BRs) are determined in crossed molecular beam experiments with soft
	electron-ionization mass-spectrometric detection at a collision energy
	of 8.4 kcal/mol. As some of the observed products can only be formed
	via ISC from triplet to singlet PESs, from the product BRs the extent
	of ISC is inferred. A new full-dimensional PES for the triplet state
	as well as spin-orbit coupling to the singlet PES are reported, and
	roughly half a million surface hopping trajectories are run on the
	coupled singlet-triplet PESs to compare with the experimental BRs
	and differential cross-sections. Both theory and experiment find
	almost equal contributions from the two PESs to the reaction, posing
	the question of how important is it to consider the ISC as one of
	the nonadiabatic effects for this and similar systems involved in
	combustion chemistry. Detailed comparisons at the level of angular
	and translational energy distributions between theory and experiment
	are presented for the two primary channel products, CH3 + HCO and
	H + CH2CHO. The agreement between experimental and theoretical functions
	is excellent, implying that theory has reached the capability of
	describing complex multichannel nonadiabatic reactions.},

	Our expression can be considered beyond Koopmans' picture since it
	is obtained for cases in which the initial neutral state is described
	multiconfigurationally - as excited states usually are - and the
	final ionic state is well represented by a single Slater determinant
	with non-frozen orbitals. It is composed of three terms: (i) the
	configuration interaction coefficients corresponding to determinants
	of the neutral molecule which differ in only one spin orbital from
	the ionic determinant, (ii) determinants depending on the overlaps
	of non-frozen orbitals of the initial neutral molecule and of the
	final ion, occupied with $\alpha$ or $\beta$ electrons, and (iii)
	the single electron matrix element between the initial and final
	orbitals, the latter representing the photo-detached electron. Exemplarily,
	transition probabilities are estimated from {MR-CCI/CASSCF} ab initio

	the first chemotherapeutic agents to be introduced for the medical
	treatment of cancer. This family of compounds has grown to include
	a variety of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives with activity
	in both solid tumours and malignant disorders of the blood. These
	agents behave as antimetabolites, compete with physiological nucleosides,
	and interact with a large number of intracellular targets to induce
	cytotoxicity. Progress has recently been made in the identification
	and characterisation of nucleoside transporters and the enzymes of
	nucleoside metabolism. In addition, there is now greater understanding
	of the molecular mechanisms of anticancer nucleoside activity, which
	provides opportunities for potentiating their antitumour effects.
	Strategies to optimise intracellular analogue accumulation and to
	enhance cancer-cell selectivity are proving beneficial in clinical
	trials. },

	by replacing the imidazole moiety of the \{RNA\} nucleobases with
	thiopene and represent a complete alphabet of emissive and isomorphic
	analogues derived from one heterocylic nucleus. An extensive study
	of absorption and emission wavelengths as well as the excited state
	charge transfer character for these molecules was conducted at the
	TD-DFT/6-311++G(2df,2p) level of theory employing the CAM-B3LYP,
	\{B3LYP\} and \{PBE0\} functionals in water and dioxane. The theoretical
	results reveal good agreement with the reported experimental data.
	The nature of the low-lying excited states are compared and contrasted
	with their naturally occurring \{RNA\} nucleobase counterparts. },

  abstract = {The present study provides new insight into the intrinsic mechanisms
	for the population of the triplet manifold in {DNA} nucleobases by
	determining, at the multiconfigurational {CASSCF/CASPT2} level, the
	singlet?triplet states crossing regions and the main decay paths
	for their lowest singlet and triplet states after near-{UV} irradiation.
	The studied singlet?triplet interacting regions are accessible along
	the minimum energy path of the initially populated singlet bright
	1$\pi\pi^*$ state. In particular, all five natural {DNA/RNA} nucleobases
	have, at the end of the main minimum energy path and near a conical
	intersection of the ground and 1$\pi\pi^*$ states, a low-energy,
	easily accessible, singlet?triplet crossing region directly connecting
	the lowest singlet and triplet $\pi\pi^*$ excited states. Adenine,
	thymine, and uracil display additional higher-energy crossing regions
	related to the presence of low-lying singlet and a triplet $n\pi^*$
	state. These funnels are absent in guanine and cytosine, which have
	the bright 1$\pi\pi^*$ state lower in energy and less accessible
	$n\pi^*$ states. Knowledge of the location and accessibility of these
	regions, in which the singlet?triplet interaction is related to large

  abstract = {Using mixed quantum--classical dynamics, the lowest part of the {UV}
	absorption spectrum and the first deactivation steps of keto-cytosine
	have been investigated. The spectrum shows several strong peaks,
	which mainly come from the S1 and S2 states, with minor contributions
	from the S3. The semiclassical trajectories, launched from these
	three states, clearly indicate that at least four states are involved
	in the relaxation of keto-cytosine to the ground state. Non-adiabatic
	transfer between the $\pi\pi^*$ and $n\pi^*$ excited states and deactivation
	via three-state conical intersections is observed in the very early
	stage of the dynamics. In less than 100 fs, a large amount of population
	is deactivated to the ground state via several mechanisms; some population
	remains trapped in the S2 state. The latter two events can be connected
	to the fs and ps transients observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and
	subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating
	the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the
	outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated
	by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion
	occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10$^{-15}$
	s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized
	in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report
	an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence
	electrons in atomic krypton ions1. We generate the ions with a controlled
	few-cycle laser field2 and then probe them through the spectrally
	resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse3,
	which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion
	of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able
	to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion
	and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble.
	Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system,
	attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable
	to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron
	motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties
	and processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract The tautomerism of 20 forms of diazinones was studied by
	the \{DFT\} and \{MP2\} methods combined with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis
	set, and, for a few structures, at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ level. The
	energy barriers were estimated for the most probable keto?enol and
	amine?imine equilibria and for all \{OH\} rotations. The stabilization
	of diazinones primarily depends on vicinity of the N-atoms and position
	of the external OH/O group. The intramolecular interaction between
	heteroatomic groups additionally stabilized the lactam \{NHCO\} and
	enol \{NOH\} systems. Six diazinones is non-Kekul\'ean and destabilized
	by over 24&#xa0;kcal/mol. When \{DFT\} and \{MP2\} calculations yielded
	vague results, the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ was used. Thus it was arbitrated
	that 3H-pirimidin-4-one is more stable than pirimidin-4-ol by as
	little as ca. 0.05&#xa0;kcal/mol in agreement with experimental references;
	1H-pirimidin-2-one is more stable than pirimidin-2-ol and 1H-pyrazin-2-one
	is more stable than pyrazin-2-ol by ca. 4&#xa0;kcal/mol and ca. 2.4&#xa0;kcal/mol,
	respectively. The barriers in the NH/NH, NH/OH tautomeric equilibria
	were predicted to exceed 45 and 30&#xa0;kcal/mol, respectively, and
	the barriers for \{OH\} rotation to not exceed 9&#xa0;kcal/mol. The
	keto?enol stabilization energy differences were shown to decrease
	monotonically with distance between the interaction centers and the
	second N-atom. Because, the localized \{CO\} bond enforces double
	bond localization, the \{HOMA\} aromaticity of keto forms is significantly
	smaller than that of the hydroxy tautomers. Our previous finding
	that the non-Kekul\'ean tautomers exhibit aromaticity higher than
	the corresponding Kekul\'ean forms with exactly one match was again
	well documented. },

	reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and proteins. Here, we show
	that the DNA damage includes covalent DNAâprotein crosslinks. An
	oligonucleotide containing a single 6-TG is photochemically crosslinked
	to cysteine-containing oligopeptides by low doses of UVA. Crosslinking
	is significantly more efficient if guanine sulphonate (GSO3)âan oxidized
	6-TG and a previously identified UVA photoproductâreplaces 6-TG,
	suggesting that GSO3 is an important reaction intermediate. Crosslinking
	occurs via oligopeptide sulphydryl and free amino groups. The oligonucleotideâoligopeptide
	adducts are heat stable but are partially reversed by reducing treatments.
	UVA irradiation of human cells containing DNA 6-TG induces extensive
	heat- and reducing agent-resistant covalent DNAâprotein crosslinks
	and diminishes the recovery of some DNA repair and replication proteins
	from nuclear extracts. DNAâprotein crosslinked material has an altered
	buoyant density and can be purified by banding in cesium chloride
	(CsCl) gradients. PCNA, the MSH2 mismatch repair protein and the
	XPA nucleotide excision repair (NER) factor are among the proteins
	detectable in the DNA-crosslinked material. These findings suggest
	that the 6-TG/UVA combination might compromise DNA repair by sequestering
	essential proteins.},

  abstract = {The excited state lifetimes of uracil, thymine and 5-fluorouracil
	have been measured using femtosecond \{UV\} fluorescence upconversion
	in various protic and aprotic polar solvents. The fastest decays
	are observed in acetonitrile and the slowest in aqueous solution
	while those observed in alcohols are intermediate. No direct correlation
	with macroscopic solvent parameters such as polarity or viscosity
	is found, but hydrogen bonding is one key factor affecting the fluorescence
	decay. It is proposed that the solvent modulates the relative energy
	of two close-lying electronically excited states, the bright ???
	and the dark n?? states. This relative energy gap controls the non-radiative
	relaxation of the ??? state through a conical intersection close
	to the Franck?Condon region competing with the ultrafast internal
	conversion to the ground state. In addition, an inverse isotope effect
	is observed in \{D2O\} where the decays are faster than in H2O. },

  abstract = {The femtosecond transient absorption technique was used to study the
	relaxation of excited electronic states created by absorption of
	267-nm light in all of the naturally occurring pyrimidine {DNA} and
	{RNA} bases in aqueous solution. The results reveal a surprising
	bifurcation of the initial excited-state population in {\textless}1
	ps to two nonradiative decay channels within the manifold of singlet
	states. The first is the subpicosecond internal conversion channel
	first characterized in 2000. The second channel involves passage
	through a dark intermediate state assigned to a lowest-energy 1$n\pi^*$
	state. Approximately 10--50\% of all photoexcited pyrimidine bases
	decay via the 1$n\pi^*$ state, which has a lifetime of 10--150 ps.
	Three- to 6-fold-longer lifetimes are seen for pyrimidine nucleotides
	and nucleosides than for the corresponding free bases, revealing
	an unprecedented effect of ribosyl substitution on electronic energy
	relaxation. A small fraction of the 1$n\pi^*$ population is proposed
	to undergo intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state in competition
	with vibrational cooling, explaining the higher triplet yields observed
	for pyrimidine versus purine bases at room temperature. Some simple
	correlations exist between yields of the 1$n\pi^*$ state and yields
	of some pyrimidine photoproducts, but more work is needed before
	the photochemical consequences of this state can be definitively
	determined. These findings lead to a dramatically different picture
	of electronic energy relaxation in single pyrimidine bases with important
	ramifications for understanding {DNA} photostability.},

	the lowest-energy bright state, a 1$\pi\pi^*$ state, which has a

	this initial bright state population bifurcates with ?60\% undergoing
	subpicosecond nonradiative decay to the electronic ground state and

	absorbs between 340 and 450 nm. The latter state is assigned to the

	in recent quantum chemical calculations (Matsika, S. J. Phys. Chem.
	A. 2004, 108, 7584) are simultaneously operative in a wide variety

  abstract = {Many chemical reactions involve a change in spin-state and are formally
	forbidden. This article summarises a number of previously published
	applications showing that a form of Transition State Theory (TST)
	can account for the kinetics of these reactions. New calculations
	for the emblematic spin-forbidden reaction HC + N2 are also reported.
	The observed reactivity is determined by two factors. The first is
	the critical energy required for reaction to occur{,} which in spin-forbidden
	reactions is often defined by the relative energy of the Minimum
	Energy Crossing Point (MECP) between potential energy surfaces corresponding
	to the different spin states. The second factor is the probability
	of hopping from one surface to the other in the vicinity of the crossing
	region{,} which is largely defined by the spin-orbit coupling matrix
	element between the two electronic wavefunctions. The spin-forbidden
	transition state theory takes both factors into account and gives
	good results. The shortcomings of the theory{,} which are largely
	analogous to those of standard TST{,} are discussed. Finally{,} it
	is shown that in cases where the surface-hopping probability is low{,}
	the kinetics of spin-forbidden reactions will be characterised by
	unusually unfavourable entropies of activation. As a consequence{,}
	reactions involving a spin-state change can be expected to compete
	poorly with spin-allowed reactions at high temperatures (or energies).},

  abstract = {The excited state dynamics of the {Na2F} cluster initiated by a femtosecond
	laser pulse is studied by quantum wave packet propagation within
	a pump-probe setup. The probe pulse is supposed to ionize the system
	to yield a photoelectron spectrum that depends on the time delay
	between the pump- and probe pulse. It is shown that the time dependence
	of the photoelectron spectrum is an extremely sensitive tool to study
	intramolecular motion of the cluster like the energy flow between
	different internal modes. The potential energy surfaces involved
	in the photoinduced process are calculated from a pseudopotential
	model with repulsive and Coulomb potentials for the ions and a quantum
	description of the excess electron via electron-Na+ and electron-F--
	pseudopotentials, polarization of the ionic cores as well as electron-ion
	correlation being added perturbatively. The nuclear motion upon laser
	excitation is described by full-dimensional quantum wave packet propagation
	using realistic laser pulse parameters. We find that the pump-probe
	signal is essentially dominated by the bending motion of the cluster
	with a periodicity of 180 fs. In addition, we also report detailed
	structures in the photoelectron spectrum which can be attributed
	to the excitation of the stretching mode. The possibility of experimental
	observation of the predicted dynamical behavior is discussed. \copyright\

  abstract = {During the past decade the understanding of photo-induced ultrafast
	dynamics in molecular systems has improved at an unforeseen speed
	and a wealth of detailed insight into the fundamental processes has
	been obtained. This review summarizes our present knowledge on ultrafast
	dynamics in isolated molecules and molecular clusters evolving after
	excitation with femtosecond pulses as studied by pump?probe analysis
	in real time. Experimental tools and methods as well as theoretical
	models are described which have been developed to glean information
	on primary, ultrafast processes in photophysics, photochemistry and
	photobiology. The relevant processes are explained by way of example?from
	wave packet dynamics in systems with a few atoms all the way to internal
	conversion via conical intersections in bio-chromophores. A systematic
	overview on characteristic systems follows, starting with diatomic
	and including larger organic molecules as well as various types of
	molecular clusters, such as micro-solvated chromophore molecules.
	For conciseness the focus is on molecular systems which remain unperturbed
	by the laser pulses?apart from the excitation and detection processes
	as such. Thus, only some aspects of controlling and manipulating
	molecular reactions by shaped and/or very intense laser pulses are
	discussed briefly for particularly instructive examples, illustrating
	the perspectives of this prospering field. The material presented
	in this review comprises some prototypical examples from earlier
	pioneering work but emphasizes studies from recent years and covers
	the most important and latest developments until January 2006.},

  abstract = {A no-pair formalism employing external-field projection operators
	correct to second order in the potential is used to calculate the
	1s energies of one-electron atoms and ground-state properties of
	the bromine and silver atoms in the framework of the multireference
	double-excitation configuration-interaction {(MRD-CI)} method. It
	is found that the relativistic two-component method that has been
	used reproduces the one-particle energies of the Dirac equation to
	order {(Z$\alpha$)3.} The operator is bounded from below and can
	be used variationally in relativistic electron-structure calculations
	of many-electron atoms and molecules. The relativistic correction
	to the total energy recovers 97\% of the relativistic correction
	of the {Dirac-Hartree-Fock} {(DHF)} result in the case of the bromine
	atom and more than 99\% in the case of the silver atom. The relativistic
	correction of the ionization potential of silver has been calculated
	to be 0.47 {eV} at the {CI} level, in good agreement with {DHF} results,
	the correlation contribution in the relativistic case being 0.42
	{eV.} The remaining discrepancy of the absolute value of 6.85 {eV}
	{(DHF} 6.34 {eV)} to experiment (7.57 {eV)} is attributed to basis-set
	deficiencies. The corresponding {CI} value of the electron affinity
	(relativistic {CI} value 1.05 {eV}, nonrelativistic 0.90 {eV)} is
	in much better agreement with experiment (1.30 {eV).} It is found
	that correlation contribution and relativistic effects are nonadditive.},

  abstract = {Restricted {Hartree--Fock} {(RHF)} and {UHF} wavefunctions for beryllium-like
	ions with nuclear charge 3 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 5 are found using a near-complete
	Slater basis set. The triplet {(RHF} $\rightarrow$ {UHF)} instability
	and correlation energy are investigated as a function of Z and we
	find that the instability vanishes for Z {\textgreater} 4.5. We reproduce
	this surprising behavior using a minimal-basis model and, by comparing
	with the stretched H2 molecule, conclude that "static" (also known
	as nondynamical, near-degeneracy, first-order, or strong) correlation
	comes in two flavors: one that can be captured by {UHF} and another
	that cannot. In the former {(Type} A), there is an "absolute near-degeneracy";
	in the latter {(Type} B), there is a "relative near-degeneracy."
	This dichotomy clarifies discussions of static correlation effects.},

	been measured. The photoelectron angular distributions indicate the
	presence of nearly degenerate electronic states of the 1-pyrazolyl-d3
	radical. Equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled-cluster
	singles and doubles {(EOMIP-CCSD)} calculations have been performed
	to study the low-lying electronic states. The calculations strongly
	suggest that three electronic states, energetically close to each
	other, are accessed in the photodetachment process. Strong interactions
	of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller type in each pair of the three states are
	evident in the calculations for the radical at the anion geometry.
	Model diabatic potentials of the three states have been constructed
	around the anion geometry in terms of the anion reduced normal coordinates
	up to the second order. An analytic method to parametrize the quadratic
	vibronic coupling {(QVC)} model potentials has been introduced. Parameters
	of the {QVC} model potentials have been determined from the {EOMIP-CCSD}
	and {CCSD(T)} calculations. Simulations of the 1-pyrazolide-d3 spectrum
	have been performed with the model Hamiltonian, treating all vibronic
	interactions amongst the three states simultaneously. The simulation
	reproduces the fine structure of the observed spectrum very well,
	revealing complicated nonadiabatic effects in the low-lying states
	of the radical. The ground state of the 1-pyrazolyl-d3 radical is
	and the electron affinity is 2.935$\pm$0.006 {eV} The first excited
	state is with a term energy of 32$\pm$1 {meV}. While the high-symmetry
	{(C2v)} stationary points of the X2A2 and A2B1 states are minima,
	that of the B2B2 state is a saddle point as a result of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller
	interactions with the other two states. The topology of the adiabatic
	potential energy surfaces is discussed.},

	to 20 eV. In order to quantify the notion of electronic non-adiabaticity
	we introduce various cross sections measuring electronically non-adiabatic
	processes. We find that non-adiabatic effects give rise to pronounced
	changes in the dynamics of the Mu+F system. In particular{,} collision-induced
	dissociation of F by Mu is an essentially electronically non-adiabatic
	process{,} proceeding efficiently by a mechanism involving transitions
	to excited repulsive PESs. In contrast{,} QCT calculations on the
	electronic ground state surface predict vanishingly small Mu+F dissociation
	cross sections. We also discuss some consequences of this behaviour

  abstract = {An on-the-fly, electric field driven, coupled electron-nuclear dynamics
	approach is developed and applied to model the photodissociation
	of water in the {A?(1B1)} excited state. In this method, a quantum
	propagator evolves the photon-induced electronic dynamics in the
	ultrafast time scale, and a quasi-classical surface hopping approach
	describes the nuclear dynamics in the slower time scale. In addition,
	strong system-field interactions are explicitly included in the electronic
	propagator. This theoretical development enables us to study rapid
	photon-induced bond dissociation dynamics and demonstrates the partial
	breakdown of electronic coherence as well as electronic population
	trapping in the excited state when the molecular vibrations detune
	the system with respect to the applied field. The method offers a
	practical way to use on-the-fly dynamics for modeling light-molecule
	interactions that lead to interesting photochemical events.},

  abstract = {An overview is given of various results of ab initio quantum dynamical
	simulations on conically intersecting potential energy surfaces.
	Here, the nonadiabatic coupling effects are typically very strong,
	leading to a femtosecond (fs) population decay of the upper electronic
	state and to a diffuse appearance of the corresponding band in the
	electronic spectrum. For the lower electronic state we demonstrate
	the possibility of a bifurcation of the wavepacket that can lead
	to a manifestation of the geometric phase. The examples chosen to
	illustrate these phenomena are triatomic hydrogen, sulfur dioxide,
	and the radical cation of benzene. The latter systems features a
	complex "web" of different multidimensional, partly coalescing, conical
	intersections between up to eight potential energy surfaces. The
	resulting stepwise femtosecond decay processes give rise to a highly
	complex vibronic dynamics that is currently being modeled to an increasing
	degree of sophistication. \copyright 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	conventionally known in solution was found to be an intrinsic molecular
	property due to extremely facile internal conversion, and therefore
	the lifetime should be largely independent of the medium at this

  abstract = {The photodissociation reaction of {SO2} via the {C 1B2} state, {SO2(C
	1B2)} $\rightarrow$ {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} was investigated by
	experimental and theoretical approaches cooperatively to clarify
	its dissociation mechanism. We measured the laser induced fluorescence
	{(LIF)} spectrum of the {C-X} band in the short {UV} wavelength region
	(210-200 nm) under jet-cooled conditions. The fluorescence quantum
	yields and the dissociation rates of individual vibronic levels were
	determined in the 220-200-nm region using (i) the {LIF} spectrum
	measured in the present study, (ii) that measured previously by Yamanouchi
	et al. {(J.} Mol. Struct. 352/353 (1995) 541) in the longer wavelength
	region above 210 nm, and (iii) the high-resolution absorption spectrum
	measured by Freeman et al. {(Planet.} Space. Sci. 32 (1984) 1125).
	The dissociation rates were also derived in the 210-200-nm region
	from the broadening of the rotational lines of the {C-X} vibronic
	transitions. It was found that the dissociation rates determined
	through two different procedures were consistent with each other,
	and that the rate increases almost exponentially as an excess energy
	above the dissociation threshold increases though there is a certain
	fluctuation of the dissociation rates reflecting a mode specificity.
	We also performed theoretical ab initio calculations to derive potential
	energy surfaces {(PESs)} of the electronic ground states and low-lying
	electronically excited states of {SO2} within the {MCSCF} and {MRCI}
	levels. The theoretical calculations showed that (i) the {PES} of
	the {21A'} state (the {C1B2} state in C2v symmetry), correlating
	with the {SO(1$\Delta$)} + {O(1D)} asymptote, crosses with the repulsive
	singlet {(31A')} state, correlating with the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)}
	asymptote, to form a pseudo-seam, (ii) the crossing pseudo-seam of
	these two {PESs} is located near the equilibrium bent angles for
	the X and C states along the energy contour of ~9700 cm-1 measured
	from the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} dissociation limit, and (iii)
	the crossing seam between the {21A'} {(C1B2)} and repulsive {23A'}
	states is located in a lower energy region than the singlet seam;
	at ~6700 cm-1 measured from the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} dissociation
	limit. On the basis of the above experimental and theoretical results
	together with the previous experimental evidence, we propose that
	(i) the photodissociation reaction via the C state proceeds mainly
	through the vibronic mixing between the C state vibronic levels with
	the quasi-bound dissociation continuum of the electronic ground {X1A1}
	state, and (ii) the additional dissociation channels may be open
	through the crossing seam with the repulsive singlet {(31A')} state
	and that with the repulsive triplet {(23A')} state in their narrow
	crossing energy regions.},

	D+ + D were used to uncover electron localization processes that

	was observed both in strong-field dissociative ionization using carrier
	envelope phase-stable few-cycle laser pulses [Kling et al.{,} Science{,}

	can be well understood using a semi-classical model that describes
	the dynamics in terms of quasi-static states that take the interaction
	of the molecule with the laser field instantaneously into account.
	The electron localization is shown to be determined by the passage

	and to predict which of the designed structures are most likely to
	be catalytic. Methods that range from quantum mechanics ({QM)} on
	truncated model systems to the treatment of the full protein with
	{ONIOM} {QM/MM} and {AMBER} molecular dynamics ({MD)} were explored.
	The most effective procedure involved molecular dynamics, and a general
	{MD} protocol was established. Substantial deviations from the ideal
	catalytic geometries were observed for a number of designs. Penetration
	of water into the catalytic site and insufficient residue-packing
	around the active site are the main factors that can cause enzyme
	designs to be inactive. Where in the past, computational evaluations
	of designed enzymes were too time-extensive for practical considerations,
	it has now become feasible to rank and refine candidates computationally
	prior to and in conjunction with experimentation, thus markedly increasing
	the efficiency of the enzyme design process.},

  abstract = {Three-state conical intersections have been located and characterized
	for cytosine and its analog 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone using multireference
	configuration-interaction ab initio methods. The potential energy
	surfaces for each base contain three different three-state intersections:
	two different S0-S1-S2 intersections ({gs/$\pi\pi^*$/$n_N\pi^*$}
	and {gs/$\pi\pi^*$/$n_O\pi^*$)} and an S1-S2-S3 intersection ({$\pi\pi^*$/$n_N\pi^*$/$n_O\pi^*$).}
	Two-state seam paths from these intersections are shown to be connected
	to previously reported two-state conical intersections. Nonadiabatic
	coupling terms have been calculated, and the effects of the proximal
	third state on these quantities are detailed. In particular, it is
	shown that when one of these loops incorporates more than one seam
	point, there is a profound and predictable effect on the phase of
	the nonadiabatic coupling terms, and as such provides a diagnostic
	for the presence and location of additional seams. In addition, it
	is shown that each of the three three-state conical intersections
	located on cytosine and 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone is qualitatively
	similar between the two bases in terms of energies and character,
	implying that, like with the stationary points and two-state conical
	intersections previously reported for these two bases, there is an
	underlying pattern of energy surfaces for 2-pyrimidinone bases, in
	general, and this pattern also includes three-state conical intersections.},

  abstract = {The ultrafast radiationless decay mechanism of photoexcited cytosine
	has been theoretically supported by exploring the important potential
	energy surfaces using multireference configuration?interaction ab
	initio methods for the gas-phase keto-tautomer free base. At vertical
	excitation, the bright state is S1 ($\pi\pi^*$) at 5.14 {eV}, with
	S2 ({$n\pi^*$)} and S3 ({$n_O\pi^*$)} being dark states at 5.29 and
	5.93 {eV}, respectively. Minimum energy paths connect the {Franck?Condon}
	region to a shallow minimum on the $\pi\pi^*$ surface at 4.31 {eV.}
	Two different energetically accessible conical intersections with
	the ground state surface are shown to be connected to this minimum.
	One pathway involves N3 distorting out of plane in a sofa conformation,
	and the other pathway involves a dihedral twist about the {C5?C6}
	bond. Each of these pathways from the minimum contains a low barrier
	of 0.14 {eV}, easily accessed by low vibronic levels. The path involving
	the N3 sofa distortion leads to a conical intersection with the ground
	state at 4.27 {eV.} The other pathway leads to an intersection with
	the ground state at 3.98 {eV}, lower than the minimum by about 0.3
	{eV.} Comparisons with our previously reported study of the fluorescent
	cytosine analogue 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone ({5M2P)} reveal remarkably
	similar conformational distortions throughout the decay pathways
	of both bases. The different photophysical behavior between the two
	molecules is attributed to energetic differences. Vertical excitation
	in cytosine occurs at a much higher energy initially, creating more
	vibrational energy than {5M2P} in the {Franck?Condon} region, and
	the minimum S1 energy for {5M2P} is too low to access an intersection
	with the ground state, causing population trapping and fluorescence.
	Calculations of vertical excitation energies of 5-amino-2-pyrimidinone
	and 2-pyrimidinone reveal that the higher excitation energy of cytosine
	is likely due to the presence of the amino group at the 4-position.},

	Gs2UUUC, was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The

	of uridine thiolation were determined by comparing the structure
	and stability of the 2-thiouridine containing oligonucleotide with
	an identical sequence containing 4-thiouridine (s4U) and also the
	normal uridine nucleo-side. Circular dichroism spectrum indicated
	an A-form helical conformation for Gs2UUUC which was further confirmed
	by 2D ROESY NMR experiments. The duplex stability of the three pentamers
	complexed with a 2?-O-methyl-ribonucleotide complementary strand,
	GmAmAmAmCm, was determined by UV thermal melting studies and by 1H

	proton NMR studies that show proton exchange rates, chemical shift

	order s2U > U > s4U. The magnitude of the effect of s2U in our model

  abstract = {The photoinduced relaxation dynamics of pyrimidine nucleobases (uracil,
	thymine, and cytosine) was studied using the surface-hopping approach
	at the semiempirical {OM2/MRCI} level of theory. The relevant potential
	energy surfaces were characterized by performing geometry optimizations
	of the energy minima of the lowest electronic states and of the most
	important conical intersections and by computing excitation energies
	at each configuration. Surface-hopping molecular dynamics simulations
	were performed to describe the nonadiabatic dynamics after excitation
	into the optically active state. In each of the molecules, the two
	lowest excited singlet states are involved in the dynamics, and there
	are competing relaxation paths. The dynamics is dominated by a two-step
	relaxation mechanism in uracil and thymine, while the direct decay
	to the ground state is most important in cytosine. For all three
	molecules, the simulations yield ultrafast {S2?S1} deexcitation within
	50 fs and internal conversion to the ground state in less than 1
	ps, consistent with recent experimental results from time-resolved
	photoelectron spectroscopy.},

	It is thus not applicable to the case where tunneling is responsible

  abstract = {It was recently shown that thymine dimers in the all-thymine oligonucleotide
	({dT)18} are fully formed in \&lt;1 ps after ultraviolet excitation.
	The speed and low quantum yield of this reaction suggest that only
	a small fraction of the conformers of this structurally disordered
	oligonucleotide are in a position to react at the instant of photon
	absorption. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that conventional
	molecular dynamics simulations can be used to predict the yield of
	cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in {DNA.} Conformations obtained from
	simulations of thymidylyl-(3'-5')-thymidine in various cosolvents
	were classified as dimerizable or nondimerizable depending on the
	distance between the C5-C6 double bonds of the adjacent thymine bases
	and the torsion angle between them. The quantum yield of cyclobutane
	pyrimidine dimer formation was calculated as the number of dimerizable
	conformations divided by the total number of conformations. The experimental
	quantum yields measured in the different solvents were satisfactorily
	reproduced using physically reasonable values for the two parameters.
	The mean dimerizable structure computed by averaging all of the dimerizable
	cis-syn conformations is structurally similar to the actual cis-syn
	dimer. Compared to the canonical B-form {TT} step, the most important
	structural property of a dimerizable conformation is its reduced
	helical twist angle of 22$^\circ$.},

	high performance liquid chromatography, infrared spectrometry, mass
	spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, ultravioletâvisible

	{CH3COCF3}, and {C6H5CH3} (toluene) from {C6H5COCH3} was observed
	with high selectivity. Strong-field control appears to have generic
	applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored
	intense laser fields (about 1013 watts per square centimeter) can
	dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently,
	the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found

  abstract = {The attosecond time-scale electron-recollision process that underlies
	high harmonic generation has uncovered extremely rapid electronic
	dynamics in atoms and diatomics. We showed that high harmonic generation
	can reveal coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in polyatomic
	molecules. By exciting large amplitude vibrations in dinitrogen tetraoxide,
	we showed that tunnel ionization accesses the ground state of the
	ion at the outer turning point of the vibration but populates the
	first excited state at the inner turning point. This state-switching
	mechanism is manifested as bursts of high harmonic light that is
	emitted mostly at the outer turning point. Theoretical calculations
	attribute the large modulation to suppressed emission from the first
	excited state of the ion. More broadly, these results show that high
	harmonic generation and strong-field ionization in polyatomic molecules
	undergoing bonding or configurational changes involve the participation
	of multiple molecular orbitals.},

	5-methyl-2-hydroxypyrimidine (5M2HP){,} the enol form of deoxythymine{,}
	using two-color resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI) and infrared-UV
	depletion spectroscopies. Unlike uracil and thymine{,} which exhibit
	structureless electronic absorption spectra{,} the vibronic spectrum
	of 5M2HP is structured with narrow vibronic bands{,} allowing for
	the first time to probe the excited state of a thymine analogue.
	The S0 state infrared depletion spectrum shows an O-H and no N-H
	stretch band{,} identifying the spectrum as that of the enol tautomer.
	The S1 ? S0 electronic transition is 1n[small pi]*{,} as evidenced
	by the rotational contour of the 000 band. Vibronic excitations of
	the in-plane benzene-type vibrations {,} {,} and are observed{,}
	while none are observed for the out-of plane fundamental excitations{,}
	implying that the 1n[small pi]* excited state of 5M2HP has a planar
	pyrimidine frame. From 1200 to 3600 cm-1 the vibronic bands become
	steadily broader{,} signaling a coupling to a lower-lying electronic
	state that increases with increasing energy. At [similar]3600 cm-1
	above the origin{,} the R2PI spectrum broadens completely{,} indicating
	that the two states are strongly mixed. Delayed ionization measurements
	show that the coupled electronic state has a >5 [small mu ]s lifetime.
	No fluorescence has been observed from the 1n[small pi]* state{,}
	implying relaxation to the lower-lying long-lived state is very efficient.
	Separate ionization potentials are measured for the 1n[small pi]*
	state (9.178 eV) and for the long-lived state ([similar]9.46 eV){,}
	hence the latter lies [similar]2200 cm-1 below the 1n[small pi]*
	state. Time-dependent B3LYP calculations of the excited states of
	5M2HP indeed predict the S1 state to be 1n[small pi]* with a planar
	hydroxypyrimidine moiety. The T1 (3[small pi][small pi]*) state is
	calculated to lie 3000 cm-1 below the S1 state{,} in excellent agreement
	with the experiment.},

	classical Drude oscillators, and fluctuating charge methods. The
	theoretical background of each method is followed by an introduction

	molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable force fields. The
	remainder of the review focuses on application studies using these
	methods. Emphasis is placed on water models, for which numerous examples
	exist, with a more thorough discussion presented on the recently
	published models associated with the Drude-based CHARMM and the AMOEBA
	force fields. The utility of polarizable models for the study of
	ion solvation is then presented followed by an overview of studies

	a basis for Our scheme which is referred to as the excited state
	structural analysis for electronic transitions. The proposed analysis
	is exemplified by various moderate and large-size conjugated molecules

  abstract = {{3D} wave-packet dynamical calculations have been performed for the
	coupled {1B1--1A2} electronics states of {SO2}, based on large-scale
	{CASSCF} calculations of Rosmus and co-workers. The full anharmonic
	(diabatic) potential energy surfaces have been used while the vibronic
	coupling terms were taken to be a linear function of the asymmetric
	stretch coordinate. Due to dipole selection rules, the initial wave
	packet is created on the lower surface of the interacting states
	but above the minimum energy of their conical intersection. The calculations
	reveal that the wave packet remains confined basically to the initially
	populated adiabatic surface even after having approached and passed
	by the intersection seam. This interesting findings is put into perspective
	by comparing with other examples of wave-packet motion on conically
	intersecting surfaces. It helps to understand some basic features
	of the complex {1A1$\rightarrow$1B1} absorption band system of {SO2.}},

	in conjunction with a trajectory surface-hopping method is used to
	study intersystem crossing effects in the S + H2 reaction. These
	calculations are based on high-quality potential surfaces that we
	have determined for the two lowest triplet states of {SH2} and globally
	determined spin-orbit coupling matrix elements that are obtained
	from {CASSCF} calculations. A previously determined surface for the
	lowest singlet state {(Ho,} {T.-S.;} Hollebeek, T.; Rabitz, H.; Chao,
	S. D.; Skodje, R. T.; Zyubin, A. S.; Mebel, A. M. J. Chem. Phys.
	2002, 116, 4124) is also used. We find that in contrast to the {O(3P)}
	+ H2 reaction, which we studied previously at the same level, there
	is significant intersystem crossing in the {S(3P)} + H2 reaction.
	In particular, for the reaction starting from triplet S + H2 close
	to the threshold, the dominant mechanism involves intersystem crossing
	to the singlet state prior to encountering the triplet barrier, and
	as a result, the thermal rate constant at low temperatures is controlled
	by intersystem crossing. This behavior occurs in part because the
	spin-orbit coupling is about 3 times larger in S than in O, but another
	important factor is the location of the singlet/triplet crossing,
	which occurs on the reagent side of the triplet barrier in S + H2
	and on the product side in O + H2. We also find that trajectories
	that undergo a triplet-to-singlet transition have higher product
	rotational excitation than those that remain on the triplet surfaces.
	For the {S(1D)} + H2 reaction, we find significant electronic quenching
	due to intersystem crossing, leading to a factor of 2 or more reduction
	in the reactive cross section, and a much flatter dependence of the
	cross section on collision energy for energies above 2.5 kcal/mol.
	This result agrees with recent molecular beam measurements.},

	The inertial prediction of equal probability formation of ground-state

	of the ground cis isomer is replaced by the {GLE} prediction of a
	preferential higher proportion of ground-state trans isomer, that

	and is enhanced in water solvent with its higher friction intensity
	and short time scales. For the fast water solvent motion, the nonadiabatic
	transitions to the S0 ground state are centered around the {CI} seam
	(which is due to the solvent coordinate{\textquoteright}s role as
	a tuning coordinate), facilitating direct transitions to the ground-state
	trans isomer. In contrast, for the slower acetonitrile solvent motion,
	the decay occurs, on average, away from the {CI} seam in regions
	with a finite free-energy gap between the excited and ground states,
	resulting in reduced trans isomer production. Some directions for
	the extension of the model description are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory using a restricted
	active space self-consistent field wave function as reference {(RASPT2/RASSCF)}
	is described. This model is particularly effective for cases where
	a chemical system requires a balanced orbital active space that is
	too large to be addressed by the complete active space self-consistent
	field model with or without second-order perturbation theory {(CASPT2}
	or {CASSCF}, respectively). Rather than permitting all possible electronic
	configurations of the electrons in the active space to appear in
	the reference wave function, certain orbitals are sequestered into
	two subspaces that permit a maximum number of occupations or holes,
	respectively, in any given configuration, thereby reducing the total
	number of possible configurations. Subsequent second-order perturbation
	theory captures additional dynamical correlation effects. Applications
	of the theory to the electronic structure of complexes involved in
	the activation of molecular oxygen by mono- and binuclear copper
	complexes are presented. In the mononuclear case, {RASPT2} and {CASPT2}
	provide very similar results. In the binuclear cases, however, only
	{RASPT2} proves quantitatively useful, owing to the very large size
	of the necessary active space.},

  abstract = { âª AbstractâTime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can be
	viewed as an exact reformulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics,
	where the fundamental variable is no longer the many-body wave function
	but the density. This time-dependent density is determined by solving
	an auxiliary set of noninteracting SchrÃ¶dinger equations, the Kohn-Sham
	equations. The nontrivial part of the many-body interaction is contained
	in the so-called exchange-correlation potential, for which reasonably
	good approximations exist. Within TDDFT two regimes can be distinguished:
	(a) If the external time-dependent potential is âsmall,â the complete
	numerical solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations can
	be avoided by the use of linear response theory. This is the case,
	e.g., for the calculation of photoabsorption spectra. (b) For a âstrongâ
	external potential, a full solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
	equations is in order. This situation is encountered, for instance,
	when matter interacts with intense laser fields. In this review we
	give an overview of TDDFT from its theoretical foundations to several
	applications both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime. },

	In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation

	the ionic H+ and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry
	results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric

  abstract = {The thiopurines, 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine, are antileukemic
	agents that are incorporated into \{DNA\} following retrieval by
	the purine salvage pathway (see [1] for a review). Their toxicity
	requires active \{DNA\} mismatch repair (MMR), and thiopurine resistance
	is an acknowledged phenotype of MMR-defective cells [2, 3]. In addition
	to these direct cytotoxic effects, \{DNA\} thiobases have distinctive
	photochemical properties [4], the therapeutic potential of which
	has not been extensively evaluated. We report here that the thiopyrimidine
	nucleoside 4-thiothymidine is incorporated into DNA. It does not
	induce MMR-related toxicity, but it interacts synergistically with
	\{UVA\} light and dramatically sensitizes cultured human cells to
	very low, nonlethal \{UVA\} doses. 4-thiothymidine induced \{UVA\}
	dose enhancements of around 100-fold in \{DNA\} repair-proficient
	cells. Nucleotide excision repair-defective xeroderma pigmentosum
	cells were sensitized up to 1000-fold, implicating bulky \{DNA\}
	photoproducts in the lethal effect. The synergistic action of thiothymidine
	plus \{UVA\} required thymidine kinase, indicating a selective toxicity
	toward rapidly proliferating cells. Cooperative \{UVA\} cytotoxicity
	is a general property of \{DNA\} thiobases, and 6-thioguanine and
	4-thiodeoxyuridine were also \{UVA\} sensitizers. Thiobase/UVA treatment
	may offer a novel therapeutic approach for the clinical management
	of nonmalignant conditions like psoriasis or for superficial tumors
	that are accessible to phototherapy. },

	the context dependence of the photodimerization yield is determined,
	and it develops a theoretical model that correctly describes the
	trends in dimerization yield with {DNA} structure. The {DNA} conjugates
	considered include {dT20}, {dA20dT20}, and three alkane-linked hairpins
	that contain a single {TT} step. The theoretical modeling of the
	[2+2] process is based on {CASSCF} electronic structure calculations
	for ethylene + ethylene, which show that photoexcitation of low-lying
	excited states leads to potential surfaces that correlate without
	significant barriers to a conical intersection with the ground state
	surface at geometries close to the dimer structure. The primary constraint
	on dimerization is the distance d between the two double bonds, and
	it is found that d {\textless} 3.52 \AA\ leads to quantum yield trends
	that match the observed trends within a factor of 3. Constraints
	on the dihedral angle between the two double bonds are not as important,
	and although it is possible to generate better dimerization yield
	predictions for some structures by including these constraints, the
	best overall picture is obtained with no constraint. For 6-4 dimerization,
	a distance g {\textless} 2.87 \AA\ and no constraint on dihedral
	angle provide an accurate description of the yield.},

	the deformation and the antisymmetrical vibrations respectively.
	The three fundamental frequencies for infinitesimal vibrations in
	the upper electronic state are v'1=794, v'2=345 and v'3=833 cm-1.
	In addition, twelve bands have been identified that correspond to
	transitions from excited vibrational levels in the normal state.
	The relatively long v'1 and v'2 progressions indicate that both the
	bond distance and the angle have changed considerably in the transition
	to the excited electronic state. The vibrationless transition at
	29622 cm-1 is weak, as one would have expected from considerations
	of the {Franck-Condon} principle. Substituting the three fundamental
	frequencies in the formula based on a valence force model, one obtains
	a value of 100$^\circ$ for the apex angle in the excited state, as
	compared with 120$^\circ$ in the normal state. The absence of any

	effects. The discussion is started by providing high-level benchmark
	calculations using the algebraic-diagrammatic construction for the
	polarization propagator in third order of perturbation theory (ADC(3)).
	These calculations support the general adequacy of the computationally
	more efficient ADC(2) method in the case of singly excited states
	but also reveal the existence of low-energy doubly excited states.
	In a next step{,} a series of oligomers with chains of two to eight
	phenyl rings is studied at the ADC(2) level showing that the confinement
	effects are dominant for small oligomers{,} while delocalized exciton
	bands emerge for larger systems. In the case of the largest oligomer{,}
	the first twenty singlet and triplet excited states are computed
	and a detailed analysis in terms of the Wannier and Frenkel models
	is presented. The presence of different Wannier bands becomes apparent{,}
	showing a general trend that exciton sizes are lowered with increasing
	quasi-momentum within the bands.},

  abstract = {Photoionization and photodissociation processes of {SO2} and {CS2}
	in vacuum {UV} are studied by using two-dimensional photoelectron
	spectroscopy with a monochromatized synchrotron radiation source.
	The principal focus is on the mechanisms of autoionization and neutral
	dissociation of superexcited states. Photoelectron spectra of {SO2}
	exhibit characteristic peaks at the electron kinetic energy below
	1.8 {eV} which are assigned as resulting from autoionizing transitions
	of excited atomic sulfur, S*, into the ground {S+(4S$^\circ$)} state.
	These S* atoms are in the singlet Rydberg states converging to {S+(2D$^\circ$).}
	The precursor molecular states, {SO2*}, are considered to be multiple-electron
	excited Rydberg states lying at the photon energy above ~22 {eV.}
	The onset of the photoelectron yield due to the atomic autoionization
	accords with that expected from the thermochemical threshold for
	the formation of S* through three-body dissociation {SO2*$\rightarrow$S*+O+O.}
	The two-dimensional photoelectron spectrum of {CS2} provides tangible
	evidence for the formation of a dipole-forbidden Rydberg state (6$\sigma$g)-1(3d$\sigma$g)11$\Sigma$g+
	at the photon energy of 14.88 {eV} which autoionizes into the v3=1
	vibrational state of the antisymmetric stretch $\nu$3 mode of {CS2+}
	{(X2$\Pi$g},$\Omega$, $\Omega$=1/2 and 3/2). This Rydberg state is
	expected to borrow substantial oscillator strength from the (6$\sigma$g)-1(5p$\sigma$u)11$\Sigma$u+
	state through vibronic coupling involving the $\nu$3 vibration.},

	in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. The well known genotoxic properties
	of {UVB} radiation (290-320 nm) mostly involve bipyrimidine {DNA}
	photoproducts. In contrast, the contribution of more-abundant {UVA}
	radiation (320-400 nm) that are not directly absorbed by {DNA} remains
	poorly understood in skin. Using a highly accurate and quantitative
	assay based on {HPLC} coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we determined
	the type and the yield of formation of {DNA} damage in whole human
	skin exposed to {UVB} or {UVA.} Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, a
	typical {UVB-induced} {DNA} damage, were found to be produced in
	significant yield also in whole human skin exposed to {UVA} through
	a mechanism different from that triggered by {UVB.} Moreover, the
	latter class of photoproducts is produced in a larger amount than
	8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, the most common oxidatively
	generated lesion, in human skin. Strikingly, the rate of removal
	of {UVA-generated} cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was lower than those
	produced by {UVB} irradiation of skin. Finally, we compared the formation
	yields of {DNA} damage in whole skin with those determined in primary
	cultures of keratinocytes isolated from the same donors. We thus
	showed that human skin efficiently protects against {UVB-induced}
	{DNA} lesions, whereas very weak protection is afforded against {UVA.}
	These observations emphasize the likely role played by the {UVA-induced}
	{DNA} damage in skin carcinogenesis and should have consequences
	for photoprotection strategies.},

	processes and their theoretical treatments are summarized and reviewed.
	These are the non-adiabatic (either radially or rotationally induced)
	transitions and the decay (auto-ionization) mechanisms of `superexcited
	states'. The interdisciplinarity of the concept of non-adiabatic
	transition is emphasized, and the present status of the semiclassical
	theory is inclusively summarized together with some numerical applications.
	Particular emphasis is put on the non-adiabatic tunnelling process
	which is supposed to be an important key mechanism for state (or
	phase) change in various fields. Definitions of two kinds of superexcited
	state are given, and their peculiarities and richness in their participating
	dynamic processes are explained. The multichannel quantum defect
	theory is outlined and recommended as a powerful theoretical tool
	for dealing with the various dynamic processes such as photo-ionization,
	photodissociation, autoionization, dissociative recombination and
	associative ionization. Some numerical applications are also presented
	in order to promote the understanding of the mechanisms. The underlying
	philosophy throughout this paper is to try to clarify the basic mechanisms
	of electronic transitions and to formulate them in a unified way

  abstract = {A multireference configuration interaction {(MR-CI)} based method
	{(Spectroscopy} {ORiented} {CI}, {SORCI)} is proposed to calculate
	energy differences between several electronic states of possibly
	different multiplicity and which can be extended to fairly large
	molecules. It combines several well-known concepts in order to achieve
	efficiency, balance, generality, stability and accuracy: (a) the
	use of any kind of (preferably small) reference space and any kind
	of initial self-consistent field treatment, (b) the use of average
	approximate natural orbitals {(AANOs)} for the states of interest,
	(c) a variational treatment of the strongly interacting many electron
	states combined with second order multireference {M{\o}ller--Plesset}
	perturbation theory for the much larger weakly interacting remainder,
	(d) the concept of difference-dedicated {CI} developed and extensively
	used by Malrieu and co-workers that avoids contributions which are
	expected to cancel in energy differences, (e) the use of the resolution-of-the
	identity approximation to avoid exceedingly large integral files.
	The method is completely devoid of intruder state problems and makes
	extensive use of truncation techniques in order to achieve computational
	efficiency. Currently three cutoffs are introduced that control the
	size of the reference space, the size of the variational treatment
	and the size of the {AANO} basis. Test calculations show that the
	method is stable against variations of these parameters over a wide
	range. A study of prototypical molecules ranging in size between
	diatomics and free-base porphin indicates that the method yields
	accurate results even with moderate basis sets and {CI} dimensions
	that typically do not exceed ~ 105 configuration state functions.
	Transition energies are typically predicted within 0.1--0.3 {eV}
	from the experimental values. \copyright 2003 American Institute

  abstract = {In this review some advanced aspects of the theoretical methods for
	the calculation of transition metal optical spectra with ab initio
	methods are discussed. Density functional theory {(DFT)} based methods
	are not covered. A brief introduction into the field of complete
	active space self-consistent field {(CASSCF)} calculations is provided.
	These methods allow the correct zeroth order description of arbitrary
	electron states including singly and doubly excited ligand field
	or atomic multiplet states. This is followed by a cursory discussion
	of the treatment of dynamic correlation by using multireference {(MR)}
	many body perturbation theory in form of a second order correction
	to the {CASSCF} energy {(CASPT2).} {MR} based configuration interaction
	{(MRCI)} methods are also briefly touched and the spectroscopy oriented
	{CI} {(SORCI)} variant developed in this laboratory is described
	in some detail. The operators to describe the leading relativistic
	effects (scalar relativity and spin-orbit coupling {(SOC))} are described
	afterwards. The {CASSCF} and {SORCI} methods are first applied to
	the calculation of the multiplets of the free dipositive and tripositive
	first-row transition metal ions followed by a discussion of calculations
	of molecular d--d multiplet states in dipositive and tripositive
	hexaquo complexes of the first transition row. We then turn to the
	subject of the treatment of {SOC} in {CASSCF} and {MRCI} based approaches
	in some detail. The final part of the review provides an introduction
	into the theory of the resonance Raman effect, the possible quantum
	chemical calculation of resonance Raman intensities, the implementation
	of the method into the {ORCA} electronic structure program system
	followed by an application to the resonance Raman and absorption
	spectra of transition metal dithiolene complexes.},

	ab initio molecular dynamics based on trajectory surface-hopping
	approach with a full-dimensional reaction model. The quantum chemical
	calculations were treated at MS-MR-CASPT2 level for 8 electrons in
	8 orbitals with the cc-pVDZ basis set. The ZhuâNakamura formula was
	employed to evaluate nonadiabatic transition probabilities. \{S1\}
	and \{S2\} states were included in the photoisomerization dynamics.
	Lifetimes and CHD:HT branching ratios were computationally estimated
	on the basis of statistical analysis of multiple executed trajectories.
	The analysis of trajectories suggested that the nonadiabatic transitions
	at the S0/S1 and S1/S2 conical intersections (CoIn) are correlated
	to the KekulÃ©-type vibration and the C3âC4âC5 bending motion, respectively.
	The one-sided branching ratio was obtained by excitations to the
	\{S2\} state; 70:30. The critical branching process was found to
	be dominated by the location of CoIn in potential energy hypersurface
	of the excited state. },

	complexes for in vivo imaging of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), we
	have recently introduced a set of M(CO)3-complexes (M = 99mTc, Re)
	containing a pendant NÏ-NO2-l-arginine moiety, a known inhibitor
	of the enzyme. Enzymatic assays with purified inducible \{NOS\} have
	shown that the non-radioactive surrogates with 3-(Re1; Ki = 84 Î¼M)
	or 6-carbon linkers (Re2; Ki = 6 Î¼M) are stronger inhibitors than
	the respective metal-free conjugates \{L1\} (Ki = 178 Î¼M) and \{L2\}
	(Ki = 36 Î¼M), with Re2 displaying the highest inhibitory potency.
	Aiming to rationalize the experimental results we have performed
	a molecular docking study combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
	and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. The higher inhibitory
	potency of Re2 arises from the stronger electrostatic interactions
	observed between the âRe(CO)3â core and the residues Arg260 and Arg382.
	This interaction is only possible due to the higher flexibility of
	its C6-carbon spacer, which links the NÏ-NO2-l-arginine moiety and
	the âRe(CO)3â organometallic core. Furthermore, \{FEP\} calculations
	were carried out and the resultant relative binding energies ( Î
	Î G bind calc = 0.690 Â± 0.028 â kcal / mol, Re1/L1 and 1.825 Â± 0.318
	kcal/mol, Re2/L2) are in accordance with the experimental results
	( Î Î G bind exp = 0.461 Â± 0.009 â kcal / mol, Re1/L1 and 1.129 Â±
	0.210 kcal/mol, Re2/L2); there is an energetic penalty for the transformation
	of the Re complexes into the ligands and this penalization is higher
	for the pair Re2/L2. },

	?(t) between the coherence vector S? and its projection onto ? is
	very small. The multiple dimension of ? is shown to provide a variety
	of paths for adiabatic inversion. The adiabatic solution is obtained

	(DFTs) were performed to clarify wavenumber assignments of the experimental

	and they were compared with \{IR\} and Raman experimental data. Good
	reproduction of the experimental wavenumbers is obtained and the%
	error is very small in the majority of cases. In the isolated state
	all the tautomer forms of 5-bromocytosine were determined and optimized.
	The wavenumbers corresponding to \{C1\} and \{C2b\} tautomers were
	identified and assigned in the \{IR\} experimental spectrum reported
	in Ar matrix. Our study confirms the existence of at least two tautomers,
	the amino-oxo and the amino-hydroxy in the isolated state. In the
	solid state the FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of 5-bromocytosine in
	the powder form were recorded in the region 400?4000&#xa0;cm?1 and
	50?3500&#xa0;cm?1, respectively. The unit cell found in the crystal
	was simulated as a tetramer form in three tautomers. Thus, it has
	been possible to assign all the 33 normal modes of vibration. The
	study indicates that the features, that are the characteristic of
	the vibrational spectra of cytosine, are retained by the spectra
	of 5-bromocytosine and it exists in the solid phase in the amino-oxo
	form. },

  abstract = {Cyclobutane?pyrimidine dimer yields in {UV-irradiated} {DNA} are controlled
	by the equilibrium between forward and reverse photoreactions. Past
	studies have shown that dimer yields are suppressed at sites adjacent
	to a purine base, but the underlying causes are unclear. In order
	to investigate whether this suppression is the result of repair by
	electron transfer from a neighboring nucleobase, the yields and dynamics
	of the reverse reaction were studied using trinucleotides containing
	a cis?syn dimer (T{\textless}{\textgreater}T) flanked on the 5? or
	the 3? side by adenine or guanine. The probability of forming an
	excited state on T{\textless}{\textgreater}T or on the purine base
	was varied by tuning the irradiation wavelength between 240 and 280
	nm. Cleavage quantum yields decrease by an order of magnitude over
	this wavelength range and are less than 1\% at 280 nm, a wavelength
	that excites the purine base with more than 95\% probability. Conditional
	quantum yields of cleavage for the trinucleotides given excitation
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T are similar in magnitude to the quantum
	yield of cleavage of unmodified T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. These
	results indicate that within experimental uncertainty all photoreversal
	in these single-stranded substrates is the result of direct electronic
	excitation of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. Photolyase-like repair
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T due to electron transfer from an adjacent
	purine is negligible in these substrates. Instead, the observed variation
	in photoreversal quantum yields for adenine- versus guanine-flanked
	cis?syn dimer could be due to uncertainties in absorption cross sections
	or to a modest quenching effect by the purine on the excited state
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. Pump?probe measurements reveal that
	the excited-state lifetimes of A or G in the dimer-containing trinucleotides
	are unperturbed by the neighboring dimer, indicating that electron
	transfer from purine base to T{\textless}{\textgreater}T is not competitive
	with rapid excited-state deactivation. Pump?probe measurements on
	unmodified T{\textless}{\textgreater}T in aqueous solution indicate
	that cleavage is most likely complete on a picosecond or subpicosecond
	time scale.},

	14 000 cm-1, [small omega]e[approximate] 80 cm-1, and re[approximate]
	3.0 {[Angstrom].} The second new state (2 3[capital Pi]0+) correlates
	to excited iodine atom, with Te[approximate] 20 000 cm-1, [small
	omega]e[approximate] 115 cm-1, and re[approximate] 3.3 {[Angstrom].}
	Non-adiabatic coupling parameters are calculated for the four avoided
	crossings, which arise due to electronic spin-orbit interaction.
	Estimated parameters of the B 3[capital {Pi]0+/B[prime} or minute]3[capital
	Sigma]-0+ crossing {(Rc[approximate]} 3.32 {[Angstrom];} V[approximate]
	120 cm-1) agree with experimental values. The previously unsuspected
	2 3[capital Pi]0-/1 1[capital Sigma]- crossing of two repulsive surfaces
	provides a new collisional deactivation channel for Br* atoms at
	relative velocities above 1000 m s-1. Several repulsive states (including
	1 1[capital Pi]1 and 2 3[capital Pi]1) intersect the {B/B[prime}
	or minute] system near the avoided crossing point, and may affect
	dynamics of {IBr} in strong laser fields.},

  abstract = {Methods using a swarm of Gaussian basis functions to represent the
	nuclear wavefunction are a very appealing way to solve the time-dependent
	Schrodinger equation (TDSE) as they avoid the conventional scaling
	bottleneck of grid-based methods and provide a grid-free trajectory
	representation of the dynamics understudy. When coupled with direct
	(on-the-fly) dynamics{,} these methods offer the ability to simulate
	quantum dynamics of larger systems in full nuclear configuration
	space and avoid the requirement of a priori fitting of a potential
	energy surface. During such simulations{,} it is often assumed that
	the limiting factor is the computational cost of the quantum chemistry
	calculations. To combat this{,} in the present paper the direct dynamics
	variational multi-configurational Gaussian (DD-vMCG) method is combined
	with electronic structure calculations accelerated by Graphical Processing
	Units (GPUs). For the systems studied{,} a protonated ammonia dimer
	and the imidazole dimer{,} it is shown that the cost of the term
	responsible for the quantum behaviour of the nuclear dynamics means
	that the computational time associated with the quantum chemistry
	quickly becomes a small part of the overall computational time. Using
	these simulations{,} an estimated scaling of the vMCG method{,} with
	respect to the number of Gaussian basis functions is reported. This
	can be used to identify when quantum chemistry is the limiting factor
	and when GPU acceleration will have a significant effect for both
	ground and excited state simulations.},

  abstract = {We compare two strategies for the semiclassical simulation of photochemical
	reactions in condensed phase (solutes in liquids, impurities in solid
	matrices, adsorbates, or photoreactive units in biological environments).
	Both strategies are based on classical nuclear trajectories, with
	surface hopping to simulate nonadiabatic transitions. In the first
	approach we calculate electronic energies and couplings by ab initio
	methods for many nuclear geometries of the reactive system (the ?solute?),
	and we fit the results by analytic functions of the internal coordinates.
	In the case of surface crossings it is mandatory to resort to a (quasi-)diabatic
	representation of the electronic states. A condensed state environment
	(the ?solvent?) is described by ordinary molecular mechanics (MM),
	and the solute?solvent interactions can be state-specific. The other
	strategy is direct, i.e. it involves the calculation of electronic
	energies and wavefunctions at each integration step of a nuclear
	trajectory. The method we have implemented is based on semiempirical
	configuration interaction calculations with floating occupation \{SCF\}
	orbitals; within this approach we have developed a hybrid quantum
	mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) procedure to represent the
	solvent, which is here briefly described for the first time. While
	the intra- and intermolecular potentials for the solvent molecules
	are of \{MM\} type, the QM/MM interaction is introduced in the semiempirical
	electronic hamiltonian, so that it influences in a state-specific
	way electronic energies and wavefunctions. Applications of both approaches
	to photoreaction dynamics are briefly described. },

  abstract = {Most current chemotherapy regimens for cancer consist of empirically
	designed combinations, based on efficacy and lack of overlapping
	toxicity. In the development of combinations, several aspects are
	often overlooked: (1) possible metabolic and biological interactions
	between drugs, (2) scheduling, and (3) different pharmacokinetic
	profiles. Antimetabolites are used widely in chemotherapy combinations
	for treatment of various leukemias and solid tumors. Ideally, the
	combination of two or more agents should be more effective than each
	agent separately (synergism), although additive and even antagonistic
	combinations may result in a higher therapeutic efficacy in the clinic.
	The median-drug effect analysis method is one of the most widely
	used methods for in vitro evaluation of combinations. Several examples
	of classical effective antimetabolite-(anti)metabolite combinations
	are discussed, such as that of methotrexate with 6-mercaptopurine
	or leucovorin in (childhood) leukemia and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) with
	leucovorin in colon cancer. More recent combinations include treatment
	of acute-myeloid leukemia with fludarabine and arabinosylcytosine.
	Other combinations, currently frequently used in the treatment of
	solid malignancies, include an antimetabolite with a DNA-damaging
	agent, such as gemcitabine with cisplatin and 5FU with the cisplatin
	analog oxaliplatin. The combination of 5FU and the topoisomerase
	inhibitor irinotecan is based on decreased repair of irinotecan-induced
	\{DNA\} damage. These combinations may increase induction of apoptosis.
	The latter combinations have dramatically changed the treatment of
	incurable cancers, such as lung and colon cancer, and have demonstrated
	that rationally designed drug combinations offer new possibilities
	to treat solid malignancies. },

	hamiltonian between a pair of Dyson orbitals - one representing the
	outgoing electron, and the other representing the remaining hole.
	The Dyson orbital concept arises naturally in the propagator formulation
	of quantum mechanics. The orbital theory presents advantages in terms
	of case of interpretational and continuity with established work.
	The application to intermediate energies is possibly by means of
	a correction factor representing the mutual correlation between the
	outgoing electron and the remaining hole. This term may be calculated
	in low order using single particle quantities obtained from a one-electron
	propagator calculation. In the very high energy limit the expression
	reduces to the Born and sudden approximation forms.},

  abstract = {In this work, the advantages of a locally diabatic propagation of
	the electronic wave function in surface hopping dynamics proceeding
	on adiabatic surfaces are presented providing very stable results
	even in challenging cases of highly peaked nonadiabatic interactions.
	The method was applied to the simulation of transport phenomena in
	the stacked ethylene dimer radical cation and the hydrogen bonded
	2-pyridone dimer. Systematic tests showed the reliability of the
	method, in situations where standard methods relying on an adiabatic
	propagation of the wave function and explicit calculation of the
	nonadiabatic coupling terms exhibited significant numerical instabilities.
	Investigations of the ethylene dimer radical cation with an intermolecular
	distance of 7.0 \AA\ provided a quantitative description of diabatic
	charge trapping. For the 2-pyidone dimer, a complex dynamics was
	obtained: a very fast ({\textless}10 fs) initial {S2/S1} internal
	conversion; subsequent excitation energy transfers with a characteristic
	time of 207 fs; and the occurrence of proton coupled electron transfer
	({PCET)} in 26\% of the trajectories. The computed characteristic
	excitation energy transfer time of 207 fs is in satisfactory agreement
	with the experimental value of 318 fs derived from the vibronic exciton
	splittings in a monodeuterated 2-pyridone dimer complex. The importance
	of nonadiabatic coupling for the {PCET} related to the electron transfer
	was demonstrated by the dynamics simulations.},

	pathway comprises four steps:? olefin coordination, [2+2] cycloaddition,
	cycloreversion, and olefin de-coordination. Two key factors have
	been found to control the detailed shape of the energy profiles:?
	the energy of distortion of the tetrahedral catalyst and the stability
	of the metallacycle intermediate, which is controlled by the {M?C}
	bond strength. The efficiency has been evaluated by calculating the
	turnover frequency ({TOF)} based on the steady-state approximation,
	and the most striking feature is that the unsymmetrical catalysts
	(X ? Y) are systematically more efficient for all systems (Mo, W,
	and Re). Overall, the Re complexes have been found to be less efficient
	than the Mo and W catalysts, except when Re is unsymmetrically substituted:?
	it is then calculated to be as efficient as the best Mo and W catalysts.},

  abstract = {A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze
	arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein
	design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced
	for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening
	of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach
	that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient
	computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date.
	Previously established computational techniques were used to generate
	an initial design, {HG-1}, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis
	of {HG-1} with molecular dynamics simulations ({MD)} and X-ray crystallography
	indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high
	flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided
	changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the
	interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase,
	{HG-2.} The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition
	state analog ({TSA)} revealed that the {TSA} was bound in the active
	site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically
	relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. {MD}
	analysis of {HG-2} led to an additional point mutation, {HG-3}, that
	produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative
	approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed {MD}
	and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises
	a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic
	catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active
	enzymes.},

	leaves the vertical Franck-Condon region and encounters a conical
	intersection with the ground electronic state of ethylenic twist
	character. In dC{,} the 1[small pi][small pi]* state decays to the
	ground state with a time constant of 1.1 +/- 0.1 ps. The lifetime
	of the 1n[small pi]* state is much longer in the canonical forms
	of both molecules: recovery of the ground state population from these
	states occurs with time constants of 18.6 +/- 1.1 ps in amino-oxo
	dC and ~114 ps in dT{,} indicating potential energy barriers to the
	1n[small pi]*/S0 conical intersections. The small fraction of the
	imino-oxo tautomer of dC present in solution has a longer-lived 1n[small
	pi]* state with a lifetime for ground state recovery of 193 +/- 55
	ps. No evidence is found for photo-induced tautomerization of amino-oxo
	dC to the imino-oxo form{,} or for population of low lying triplet
	states of this nucleoside. In contrast{,} ~8% of the UV-excited dT
	molecules access the long-lived T1 (3[small pi][small pi]*) state
	through the 1n[small pi]* state. The primary influence of the solvent
	appears to be the degree to which it destabilizes the states of 1n[small
	pi]* character{,} with consequences for the lifetimes of these states
	as well as the triplet state yields.},

  abstract = {The electronic energy relaxation of 1-nitronaphthalene was studied
	in nonpolar, aprotic, and protic solvents in the time window from
	femtoseconds to microseconds. Excitation at 340 or 360 nm populates
	the {Franck--Condon} S1($\pi$$\pi$*) state, which is proposed to
	bifurcate into two essentially barrierless nonradiative decay channels
	with sub-200 fs lifetimes. The first main decay channel connects
	the S1 state with a receiver Tn state that has considerable n$\pi$*
	character. The receiver Tn state undergoes internal conversion to
	populate the vibrationally excited T1($\pi$$\pi$*) state in 2--4
	ps. It is shown that vibrational cooling dynamics in the T1 state
	depends on the solvent used, with average lifetimes in the range
	from 6 to 12 ps. Furthermore, solvation dynamics competes effectively
	with vibrational cooling in the triplet manifold in primary alcohols.
	The relaxed T1 state undergoes intersystem crossing back to the ground
	state within a few microseconds in N2-saturated solutions in all
	the solvents studied. The second minor channel involves conformational
	relaxation of the bright S1 state (primarily rotation of the {NO2-group)}
	to populate a dissociative singlet state with significant charge-transfer
	character and negligible oscillator strength. This dissociative channel
	is proposed to be responsible for the observed photochemistry in
	1-nitronaphthalene. Ground- and excited-state calculations at the
	density functional level of theory that include bulk and explicit
	solvent effects lend support to the proposed mechanism where the
	fluorescent S1 state decays rapidly and irreversibly to dark excited
	states. A four-state kinetic model is proposed that satisfactorily
	explains the origin of the nonradiative electronic relaxation pathways
	in 1-nitronaphthalene.},

  abstract = {Exact decoupling of positive- and negative-energy states in relativistic
	quantum chemistry is discussed in the framework of unitary transformation
	techniques. The obscure situation that each scheme of decoupling
	transformations relies on different, but very special parametrizations
	of the employed unitary matrices is critically analyzed. By applying
	the most general power series ansatz for the parametrization of the
	unitary matrices it is shown that all transformation protocols for
	decoupling the Dirac Hamiltonian have necessarily to start with an
	initial free-particle {Foldy--Wouthuysen} step. The purely numerical
	iteration scheme applying X-operator techniques to the {Barysz--Sadlej--Snijders}
	{(BSS)} Hamiltonian is compared to the analytical schemes of the
	{Foldy--Wouthuysen} {(FW)} and {Douglas--Kroll--Hess} {(DKH)} approaches.
	Relying on an illegal 1/c expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian around
	the nonrelativistic limit, any higher-order {FW} transformation is
	in principle ill defined and doomed to fail, irrespective of the
	specific features of the external potential. It is shown that the
	{DKH} method is the only valid analytic unitary transformation scheme
	for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Its exact infinite-order version can be
	realized purely numerically by the {BSS} scheme, which is only able
	to yield matrix representations of the decoupled Hamiltonian but
	no analytic expressions for this operator. It is explained why a
	straightforward numerical iterative extension of the {DKH} procedure
	to arbitrary order employing matrix representations is not feasible
	within standard one-component electronic structure programs. A more
	sophisticated ansatz based on a symbolical evaluation of the {DKH}
	operators via a suitable parser routine is needed instead and introduced
	in Part {II} of this work. \copyright 2004 American Institute of

  abstract = {The reaction {CH(X $^2\Pi$)+N$_2$(X $^1\Sigma^*_g$) $\rightarrow$
	HCN(X $^1\Sigma^+$) +N($^4$S)} has been suggested as the initial
	step in the formation of ''prompt'' {NO} in flame fronts. Since the
	reaction is spin-forbidden an intersystem crossing must occur in
	the vicinity of the allowed crossing hypersurface of the lowest doublet
	and quartet potential energy surfaces. In this work the electronic
	structure aspects to this intersystem crossing are considered using
	multireference configuration interaction wave functions. The key
	to this treatment is a new implementation of a constrained analytic
	gradient search algorithm which is used to locate regions of the
	doublet--quartet crossing hypersurface. In those regions of nuclear
	coordinate space the spin--orbit coupling (matrix elements of {HSO)}
	is determined using the full microscopic {Breit--Pauli} spin--orbit
	interaction (that is both the spin--orbit and spin--other--orbit
	contributions are included). Included in this treatment are the largest
	configuration state function expansions, 700000--900000 terms, used
	to date to evaluate matrix elements {HSO} within the full {Breit--Pauli}
	approximation. Our conclusions are as follows. The lowest energy
	point on the doublet--quartet crossing hypersurface corresponds,
	approximately, to a C2v nuclear configuration in which the {HC} moiety
	has been inserted into a highly stretched N2 bond. The spin--orbit
	coupling in this region is approximately 12 cm$^{-1}$. This region
	is estimated to be endoergic with respect to the reactant channel
	asymptote by approximately 7.5 kcal/mol. A second region of the crossing
	hypersurface corresponds to a perturbed nitrogen atom collinearly
	adjacent to the nitrogen side of the {HCN} moiety which is in its
	ground electronic state. The spin--orbit coupling in this region
	is considerably larger, approximately 44 cm$^{-1}$. However, this
	region is estimated to be endoergic with respect to the reactant
	channel asymptote by over 50 kcal/mol. A qualitative {Landau--Zener}
	analysis of the electronic structure data provides the first computational
	evidence supporting the role of this reaction in the production of
	prompt {NO} in flame fronts.},

  abstract = { Gaussian wavepacket methods are an attractive way to solve the time-dependent
	SchrÃ¶dinger equation (TDSE). They have an underlying trajectory picture
	that has a natural connection to semi-classical mechanics, allowing
	a simple pictorial interpretation of an evolving wavepacket. They
	also have better scaling with system size compared to conventional
	grid-based techniques. Here we review the variational multi-configurational
	Gaussian (vMCG) method. This is a variational solution to the TDSE,
	with explicit coupling between the Gaussian basis functions, resulting
	in a favourable convergence on the exact solution. The implementation
	of the method and its performance will be discussed with examples
	from non-adiabatic photo-excited dynamics and tunneling to show that
	it can correctly describe both of these strongly quantum mechanical
	processes. Particular emphasis is given to the implementation of
	the direct dynamics variant, DD-vMCG, where the potential surfaces
	are calculated on-the-fly via an interface to quantum chemistry programs.

  abstract = {Nucleophilic catalysis is a general strategy for accelerating ester
	and amide hydrolysis. In natural active sites, nucleophilic elements
	such as catalytic dyads and triads are usually paired with oxyanion
	holes for substrate activation, but it is difficult to parse out
	the independent contributions of these elements or to understand
	how they emerged in the course of evolution. Here we explore the
	minimal requirements for esterase activity by computationally designing
	artificial catalysts using catalytic dyads and oxyanion holes. We
	found much higher success rates using designed oxyanion holes formed
	by backbone {NH} groups rather than by side chains or bridging water
	molecules and obtained four active designs in different scaffolds
	by combining this motif with a Cys-His dyad. Following active site
	optimization, the most active of the variants exhibited a catalytic
	efficiency ({kcat/KM)} of 400 M?1 s?1 for the cleavage of a p-nitrophenyl
	ester. Kinetic experiments indicate that the active site cysteines
	are rapidly acylated as programmed by design, but the subsequent
	slow hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate limits overall catalytic
	efficiency. Moreover, the Cys-His dyads are not properly formed in
	crystal structures of the designed enzymes. These results highlight
	the challenges that computational design must overcome to achieve
	high levels of activity.},

	is proposed. Instead of constructing and interaction matrix, the
	expansion coefficients are obtained directly from the list of two-electron
	integrals by means of an iterative procedure. At present, the method
	can be applied to systems with a closed-shell ground state including
	all singly and doubly excited configurations. The number of terms

	-- 105. Wavefunctions for {NH3} with 4336 and {H2O} with 2458 configurations

	of the 6C3HED lymphosarcoma after treatment with chemotherapeutic
	agents.Through the use of this technic it has been possible to test,
	at the cellular level, the hypothesis that if one could incorporate
	into the chromosomes a thio-containing analog, then it might be possible
	to sensitize the cell to a second compound having a selective affinity
	for such radicals.Thio-containing compounds, such as 6-mercaptopurine
	and 5-methylthiouracil, did not affect the cytologic picture when
	used alone, whereas 6-thioguanine and 2-thiocytosine did.The compounds
	used further to test the hypothesis, nitrogen mustard and mapharsen,
	both produced marked cytologic abnormalities on these cells.The cytologic
	data obtained showed that the combination of 6-mercaptopurine plus
	nitrogen mustard, 6-thioguanine plus nitrogen mustard, and 2-thiocytosine
	plus mapharsen supported the hypothesis by producing an effect greater
	than when either compound was used alone; and that the union probably
	occurred within the cell.The data also show that 6-mercaptopurine
	and 5-methylthiouracil inactivated the effects of mapharsen, whereas
	it appeared that thioguanine did not combine with mapharsen, nor
	did 2-thiocytosine or 5-methyl thiouracil combine with nitrogen mustard.The
	damage, as evidenced by the cytological studies, was, however, not
	paralleled by increased survival times. This paradox is discussed

	of 1-methyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (1MP) in water{,} acetonitrile{,}
	methanol{,} and 1{,}4-dioxane are reported here. As deduced from
	steady state fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
	the S1 lifetime of 1MP is strongly affected by the solvent. The lifetimes
	range from 400 ps for water to 40 ps for 1{,}4-dioxane. Internal
	conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) contribute to the
	S1 decay. The solvent effect on the IC rate constant is more pronounced
	than on the ISC constant. The quantum yields for the consumption
	of 1MP (values for nitrogen purged solvents) are large for methanol
	(0.35) and 1{,}4-dioxane (0.24) and small for acetonitrile (0.02)
	and water (0.003). Hydrogen abstraction from the solvent by the triplet

  abstract = {For the past several decades, we have been able to directly probe
	the motion of atoms that is associated with chemical transformations
	and which occurs on the femtosecond (10(-15)-s) timescale. However,
	studying the inner workings of atoms and molecules on the electronic
	timescale(1-4) has become possible only with the recent development
	of isolated attosecond (10(-18)-s) laser pulses(5). Such pulses have
	been used to investigate atomic photoexcitation and photoionization(6,7)
	and electron dynamics in solids(8), and in molecules could help explore
	the prompt charge redistribution and localization that accompany
	photoexcitation processes. In recent work, the dissociative ionization
	of H-2 and D-2 was monitored on femtosecond timescales(9) and controlled
	using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses(10). Here we report a
	molecular attosecond pump-probe experiment based on that work: H-2
	and D-2 are dissociatively ionized by a sequence comprising an isolated
	attosecond ultraviolet pulse and an intense few-cycle infrared pulse,
	and a localization of the electronic charge distribution within the
	molecule is measured that depends-with attosecond time resolution-on
	the delay between the pump and probe pulses. The localization occurs
	by means of two mechanisms, where the infrared laser influences the
	photoionization or the dissociation of the molecular ion. In the
	first case, charge localization arises from quantum mechanical interference
	involving autoionizing states and the laser-altered wavefunction
	of the departing electron. In the second case, charge localization
	arises owing to laser-driven population transfer between different
	electronic states of the molecular ion. These results establish attosecond
	pump-probe strategies as a powerful tool for investigating the complex
	molecular dynamics that result from the coupling between electronic
	and nuclear motions beyond the usual {Born-Oppenheimer} approximation.},

  abstract = {{UV} irradiation at 254 nm of 2?-O,5-dimethyluridylyl(3?-5?)-2?-O,5-dimethyluridine
	(1a) and of natural thymidylyl(3?-5?)thymidine (1b) generates the
	same photoproducts ({CPD} and ({6?4)PP;} responsible for cell death
	and skin cancer). The ratios of quantum yields of photoproducts obtained
	from 1a (determined herein) to that from 1b are in a proportion close
	to the approximately threefold increase of stacked dinucleotides
	for 1a compared with those of 1b (from previous circular dichroism
	results). 1a and 1b however are endowed with different predominant
	sugar conformations, C3?-endo (1a) and C2?-endo (1b). The present
	investigation of the stacked conformation of these molecules, by
	unrestrained state-of-the-art molecular simulation in explicit solvent
	and salt, resolves this apparent paradox and suggests the following
	main conclusions. Stacked dinucleotides 1a and 1b adopt the main
	characteristic features of a single-stranded A and B form, respectively,
	where the relative positions of the backbone and the bases are very
	different. Unexpectedly, the geometry of the stacking of two thymine
	bases, within each dinucleotide, is very similar and is in excellent
	agreement with photochemical and circular dichroism results. Analyses
	of molecular dynamics trajectories with conformational adiabatic
	mapping show that 1a and 1b explore two different regions of conformational
	space and possess very different flexibilities. Therefore, even though
	their base stacking is very similar, these molecules possess different
	geometrical, mechanical, and dynamical properties that may account
	for the discrepancy observed between increased stacking and increased
	photoproduct formations. The computed average stacked conformations
	of 1a and 1b are well-defined and could serve as starting models
	to investigate photochemical reactions with quantum dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {One of the great dream experiments in Science is to directly observe
	atomic motions as they occur. Femtosecond electron diffraction provided
	the first 'light' of sufficient intensity to achieve this goal by
	attaining atomic resolution to structural changes on the relevant
	timescales. This review covers the technical progress that made this
	new level of acuity possible and gives a survey of the new insights
	gained from an atomic level perspective of structural dynamics. Atomic
	level views of the simplest possible structural transition, melting,
	are discussed for a number of systems in which both thermal and purely
	electronically driven atomic displacements can be correlated with
	the degree of directional bonding. Optical manipulation of charge
	distributions and effects on interatomic forces/bonding can be directly
	observed through the ensuing atomic motions. New phenomena involving
	strongly correlated electronâlattice systems are also discussed in
	which optically induced changes in the potential energy landscape
	lead to ballistic structural changes. Concepts such as the structural
	order parameters are now directly observable at the atomic level
	of inspection to give a remarkable view of the extraordinary degree
	of cooperativity involved in strongly correlated electronâlattice
	systems. These recent examples, in combination with time-resolved
	real space imaging now possible with electron probes, are truly defining
	an emerging field that holds great promise to make a significant
	impact in how we understand structural dynamics. This article is
	dedicated to the memory of Professor David John Hugh Cockayne, a
	world leader in electron microscopy, who sadly passed away in December.},

	of the screened pyrimidine derivatives depends on their topology.
	While macrocyclic tosylates are more active against bacteria than

	material, its constituent chromophores, the five natural DNA/RNA
	nucleobases cytosine, thymine, uracil, adenine, and guanine, should
	be able to efficiently dissipate absorbed radiation, \{UV\} specifically,
	avoiding as much as possible photoreactions leading to lesions. It
	has been established experimentally and theoretically that efficient
	internal conversion channels, still open and relevant in the oligomer-stacked
	strands, exist in the monomers allowing an effective waste of the
	initial energy. Previous evidences cannot explain, however, why minor
	differences in the molecular structure modify drastically the photochemistry
	of the systems, leading for many derivatives to slower decays, sometimes
	to intense fluorescence, and also to reactivity. Using the accurate
	CASPT2//CASSCF quantum chemical method and the Photochemical Reaction
	Path Approach it is determined that the five natural nucleobases
	display barrierless paths from the allowed excited state toward accessible
	conical intersection seams with the ground state. Such features are
	known to be the funnels for efficient energy decay and fluorescence
	quenching. Modified nucleobases, except the methylated ones, are
	predicted less photostable because they display energy barriers along
	lowest-energy paths and hence restricted accessibility of the internal
	conversion channel. This specificity speaks in favor of the choice
	of the biological nucleobases by natural selection based on their
	resistance to photochemical damage. Whereas natural and methylated
	nucleobases, also frequent in the genetic code, are photostable and
	cannot be photochemically discarded, other non-natural nucleobases
	may have been eliminated at early stages of the natural selection
	process. },

	known photoproducts follows the irreversible path See pdf 379.pdf
	Thus dimers are distinguished from other photoproducts by the fact
	that they can be monomerized, as well as formed, by ultraviolet irradiation.
	At large incident fluxes of photons the steady-state value of dimers
	depends on wavelength and {pH}, as well as on other characteristics
	of the surrounding medium. The number of dimers in an irradiated
	polynucleotide may be decreased by purely photochemical means, whereas
	this is not true for most other photoproducts, for which continued
	irradiation, irrespective of wavelength, always results in the formation
	of more photoproduct (37). The wavelength dependence of the steady-state
	for dimers is also reflected in the biological activity of irradiated
	transforming {DNA.} This experiment and the fact that photoreactivating
	enzyme plus visible light monomerizes dimers (and has not been demonstrated
	to have any effect on other photoproducts) are the strongest lines
	of experimental evidence that pyrimidine dimers of the cyclobutane
	type are biologically important lesions and can account for a large
	fraction of the effects of ultraviolet light on {DNA} in solution.
	Insofar as {DNA} is one of the more important biological structures,
	such dimers, when formed, account for a large part of the effects
	of ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.},

	Monte Carlo sampling. The simplest non-unitary version of the theory
	also obviates the need to invert large overlap matrices. Unitary

	uncoupled semiclassical initial value representation (IVR) techniques

	effectively and compactly in the form of a two-rooted directed graph.
	Each member (configuration function) of the canonical basis is represented

	subgraphs of the distinct row graph, and in terms of certain "loops"
	contained in them. A relatively small number of basic subgraphs can
	be used to generate most of the information needed in the calculation.
	Certain problems associated with matrix elements of products of generators
	of the unitary group remain to be solved before an effective formalism
	for large-scale electronic structure calculations is obtained, but

  abstract = {The theory of {MCSCF} and {CI} energy derivatives with respect to
	geometrical variations is briefly reviewed with special attention
	given to the {MCSCF} and {MRCI} energy gradients. A computational
	procedure is proposed for {MRCI} energy gradients that does not require
	the solution to any "coupled-perturbed {MCSCF"} equations, it does
	not require any expensive {direct-CI} matrix-vector products involving
	derivative integrals, and it does not require any derivative integrals
	to be transformed from the {AO} basis to the {MO} basis. An additional
	feature is that it does not require any changes to existing {MCSCF}
	gradient evaluation programs in order to compute {MRCI} gradients.
	The only difference in the two cases is the exact nature of the data
	passed to the gradient evaluation program from the previous steps

	procedure and for one additional {MCSCF} iteration. For large scale

  abstract = {The {COLUMBUS} program system is a collection of Fortran programs
	for performing general multireference single- and double-excitation
	configuration interaction {(MRSDCI)} wave function optimization based
	on the graphical unitary group approach. The program system also
	includes integral generation, {SCF} and {MCSCF} orbital optimization,
	integral transformation, and wave function analysis programs. The
	original program system was written in 1980 to 1981. Since that time,
	it has evolved into one of the most popular {MRSDCI} program systems
	used in the computational chemistry community. The discussion of
	this evolution will include the exploitation of efficient matrix-matrix
	and matrix-vector product computational kernels, the use of generally
	contracted symmetry-adapted orbital basis sets, general Hamiltonian
	diagonalization procedures, energy-based internal walk selection,
	flexible {DRT} specification, improved coupling-coefficient evaluation
	methods, coupled-pair functional and multireference {CPF} capabilities,
	and density matrix construction. The numerous versions of the program
	system that are maintained at different sites and on different computers
	are now in the process of being merged. The source code for this
	combined version will be made available to the computational chemistry
	community. The source code for a specific computer may be generated
	from the source code for another computer by a single pass through
	a simple filter utility that is included with the program system.
	The directly supported computers will initially include various models
	of {VAX}, Cray, {FPS}, {IBM}, {CDC}, and {ETA} machines with the
	addition of other machines shortly thereafter. The ongoing developments
	of the {COLUMBUS} system that are discussed include a new method
	for computing analytic energy gradients for {MRSDCI} wave functions.
	This effective-density-matrix based method avoids the "coupled perturbed
	{MCSCF"} solutions for each coordinate direction, avoids the transformation
	of any derivative-integral quantities from the {AO} to the {MO} basis,
	avoids the transformation of the coupling coefficients from the {MO}
	to the {AO} basis, allows a subset of the {MCSCF} doubly occupied
	orbitals to be frozen in the {CI} wave function, and allows the {MRSDCI}
	wave function to be generated from general reference {CSFs} that
	are not necessarily related to the {MCSCF} expansion {CSFs.}},

	the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that

	It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values

	to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally,

  abstract = {We present a new inventory of global sulfur dioxide emissions from
	anthropogenic activities for the years 1980--2000. Emissions were
	estimated in 11 world regions using country-level emissions inventories
	and regional fossil fuel sulfur content information. Estimated global
	emissions in 1990 are 72 {TgS} with an estimated uncertainty of $\pm$8\%
	due to random errors with additional systematic errors that suggest
	that true emissions may be higher than this central value. We estimate
	that 56\% of 1990 world emissions are from coal, 24\% from oil, 15\%
	from industrial processes and 3\% from biomass burning. When our
	results are compared with other studies, they are similar at the
	global-mean level, but show marked differences at the regional level.
	Globally, emissions have been roughly constant from 1980 to the present.
	However, a significant shift has occurred in the spatial distribution
	of emissions. While 60\% of global emissions in 1980 were from around
	the North Atlantic basin, this region contributed less than 40\%
	of the global total by 1995 and will contribute even less in the
	future. Currently, based on our estimates, the centrally planned
	Asia {(CPA)} region, dominated by China, is the largest contributor
	to global sulfur dioxide emissions. A gridded data set for 1990 emissions
	is also produced, including a consistent seasonal cycle and a stratification
	of emissions into low and elevated releases. Implications for climate
	modeling and detection studies are discussed.},

	of the relative yields of the cation states populated following ionization
	and compare these to the results of a recently developed ab initio--type
	numerical model designed to compute strong-field ionization of molecules,
	the so-called time-dependent resolution in ionic states ({TD-RIS)}
	method. In analogy with one-photon {XUV} ionization, where the photoionization
	matrix elements can be related to the Dyson orbitals, we construct
	estimates for the yield of strong-field ionization ({SFI)} to different
	cation states based on the Dyson orbital norms and the Keldysh tunneling
	ionization rate. In the case of {XUV} ionization, the Dyson norms
	are shown to be good predictors of the relative cation yields when
	compared with the {TD-RIS} yields. The Dyson- and Keldysh-based models
	underestimate the yield to excited cation states in the case of {SFI.}
	The increased yield to the excited cation states in the {TD-RIS}
	results is attributed to the inclusion of multielectron effects and
	continuum structure not present in the simple models. The molecular
	Ammosov-Delone-Krainov ({MO-ADK)} method of calculating {SFI} is
	also considered. This later method is seen to agree more closely
	with the Dyson- and Keldysh-based estimates as it also fails to capture
	the multielectron effects and continuum structure included in the

  abstract = {In biological/bioenergetics research the response of a complex system
	to an externally applied perturbation is often studied. Spectroscopic
	measurements at multiple wavelengths are used to monitor the kinetics.
	These time-resolved spectra are considered as an example of multiway
	data. In this paper, the methodology for global and target analysis
	of time-resolved spectra is reviewed. To fully extract the information
	from the overwhelming amount of data, a model-based analysis is mandatory.
	This analysis is based upon assumptions regarding the measurement
	process and upon a physicochemical model for the complex system.
	This model is composed of building blocks representing scientific
	knowledge and assumptions. Building blocks are the instrument response
	function (IRF), the components of the system connected in a kinetic
	scheme, and anisotropy properties of the components. The combination
	of a model for the kinetics and for the spectra of the components
	results in a more powerful spectrotemporal model. The model parameters,
	like rate constants and spectra, can be estimated from the data,
	thus providing a concise description of the complex system dynamics.
	This spectrotemporal modeling approach is illustrated with an elaborate
	case study of the ultrafast dynamics of the photoactive yellow protein.

	for the case of nonadiabatic molecular photodissociation at an avoided
	crossing. Using the {NRDSE} exclusively, both the electronic branching
	ratio and predissociation lifetime may be controlled. Infrared control
	pulses are used to modify the field-free dynamical evolution during
	traversal of the avoided crossing, thus controlling the nonadiabatic
	branching ratio. Predissociation lifetimes may be either increased
	or decreased using properly timed short infrared pulses to modify
	phase differences between the diabatic wave packets. In contrast
	with the limiting cases of perturbative control (interference between
	transitions) and strong field control with ionizing laser fields,
	control via the {NRDSE} may be thought of as reversibly modifying
	the effective Hamiltonian during system propagation.},

	investigated by optically detected magnetic resonance in zero magnetic
	field. The zero field splittings (ZFS) and the individual sublevel
	kinetic parameters are reported. The \{ZFS\} (|D|, |E|) values (in

	The triplet state lifetimes decrease in the same order, and both
	effects are attributed to an internal heavy atom effect of sulfur
	substitution. The vibronic structure of the phosphorescence emission
	indicates that the thiouracil phosphorescent states are 3(?, ?*).
	The low phosphorescence quantum yields of 1-Me-s4 U and of 1-Me-s2s4U
	result from radiationless decay of the triplet state rather than
	from inefficient intersystem crossing from the excited singlet state.
	The efficient radiationless decay of the triplet state appears to
	be a feature of the S-substitution at the 4-position of uracil. Phosphorescence
	polarization measurements of the individuals triplet sublevel emissions
	at ca. 1.2 K are consistent with 1-Me-s2U and 1-Me-s4U being non-planar
	in the phosphorescent state; the thiouracil phosphorescence from
	each triplet sublevel is polarized in the average plane of the distorted
	molecule. In the absence of ??? separability, spin?orbit mixing of
	1(?, ?*) and 3(?, ?*) states is enhanced and the radiative properties
	of the triplet state may be dominated by this mechanism rather than
	by the mixing of 1(n, ?*), 1(?, ?*), or 1(?, ?*) with 3(?, ?* states
	which generally is the dominant mechanism for planar aromatic molecules.

	only two $\pi\pi^*$ transitions; the other two, less resolved bands
	cannot be type $\pi\pi^*$, and are probably not even $n\pi^*$ but
	rather vibrational subbands (see {figure).Theoretical} vertical excitation
	energies and simulated {UV} spectrum are reported for the canonical
	(amino-oxo) form of cytosine. The calculations were performed by
	the {EOM-CCSD} and {EOM-CC3} methods with basis sets up to triple-zeta
	quality. Beyond vertical excitations, the complete vibronic spectrum
	has been determined the first time, using the linear vibronic coupling
	({LVC)} method. On the basis of the computed data, a critical review
	of the available experimental information ({UV} spectra, linear dichroism,
	Resonance Raman and {REMPI} measurements) has led to the surprising
	conclusion that cytosine has only two, rather than four, observable
	electronic transitions in the {UV} range up to 60 000 cm$^{-1}$.
	The result may be of crucial importance for future photochemical
	studies.},

  abstract = {In light of the fundamental importance and renewed interest of the
	tunnel phenomena, we review the recent development of semiclassical
	tunneling theory, particularly from the view point of ?tunneling
	path?, beginning from a simple one-dimensional formula to semiclassical
	theories making use of the analytic continuation, in time, coordinates,
	or momentum, which are the stationary solutions of semiclassical
	approximations to the Feynman path integrals. We also pay special
	attention to the instanton path and introduce various conventional
	and/or intuitive ideas to generate tunneling paths, to which one-dimensional
	tunneling theory is applied. Then, we review the recent progress
	in generalized classical mechanics based on the Hamilton?Jacobi equation,
	in which both the ordinary Newtonian solutions and the instanton
	paths are regarded as just special cases. Those new complex-valued
	solutions are generated along real-valued paths in configuration
	space. Such non-Newtonian mechanics is introduced in terms of a quantity
	called ?parity of motion?. As many-body effects in tunneling, illustrative
	numerical examples are presented mainly in the context of the Hamilton
	chaos and chemical reaction dynamics, showing how the multidimensional
	tunneling is affected by the system parameters such as mass combination
	and anisotropy of potential functions. },

  abstract = {Abstract \{UV\} absorption, circular dichroism and emission spectroscopy
	as well as nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption measurements
	were used to characterize the excited states of 2-thiothymine (2TT),
	its riboside (2TTR) and deoxyriboside (2TTD) in acetonitrile (ACN)
	solution. The lowest triplet state (T1) could be observed exclusively
	in the experiments. Upon excitation to higher singlet states (266nm),
	the \{T1\} ($\pi\pi^*$) states of the investigated compounds were
	formed on an ultrafast time scale with an efficiency approaching
	unity. These \{T1\} states were characterized by their intrinsic
	lifetimes ( ? T 0 ) and rate constants of self-quenching (kSQ), phosphorescence
	(kP), and nonradiative processes (?kNR). In the series of compounds
	studied only 2TT exhibited a weak room-temperature phosphorescence,
	and the spectrum of this 2TT emission was recorded for the first
	time. In the absence of self quenching, nonradiative processes (NR)
	are the dominant channel of the decay of 2TT and its nucleosides
	in their \{T1\} states. Despite the chromophore being the same in
	all of the compounds studied, the decay dynamics of the nucleosides?
	\{T1\} states differed considerably from that of the \{T1\} state
	of 2TT. The ?kNR values determined for the derivatives containing
	a ribosyl (in 2TTR) or a deoxyribosyl (in 2TTD) substituent in the
	position ? to the thiocarbonyl group were an order of magnitude larger,
	and as a consequence, the lifetimes ( ? T 0 ) shorter (by factor
	of 14 and 22 for 2TTD and 2TTR, respectively) as compared to 2TT.
	The reason for the enhanced rate of nonradiative decay in the nucleosides
	is discussed based on the results obtained from additional experiments
	including the determination of the \{T1\} lifetime for the deuterated
	derivative of 2TTR and the intermolecular quenching of 2TT by ribose
	molecules. The factors which might be responsible for this substituent
	effect (on the nonradiative decay) such as an intramolecular or an
	intermolecular H bond formation involving sugar \{OH\} groups as
	well as a reversible H abstraction from the sugar ?-substituent in
	the nucleosides appear to be not important. },

  abstract = {The low-lying excited singlet states of the keto, enol, and keto-imine
	tautomers of cytosine have been investigated employing a combined
	density functional/multireference configuration interaction ({DFT/MRCI)}
	method. Unconstrained geometry optimizations have yielded out-of-plain
	distorted structures of the $\pi\pi^*$ and $n\pi^*$ excited states
	of all cytosine forms. For the keto tautomer, the {DFT/MRCI} adiabatic
	excitation energy of the $\pi\pi^*$ state (4.06 {eV} including zero-point
	vibrational energy corrections) supports the resonant two-photon
	ionization ({R2PI)} spectrum (Nir et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.
	2002, 5, 4780). On its S1 potential energy surface, a conical intersection
	between the 1$\pi\pi^*$ state and the electronic ground state has
	been identified. The barrier height of the reaction along a constrained
	minimum energy path amounts to merely 0.2 {eV} above the origin and
	explains the break-off of the {R2PI} spectrum. The 1$\pi\pi^*$ minimum
	of the enol tautomer is found at considerably higher excitation energies
	(4.50 {eV).} Because of significant geometry shifts with respect
	to the ground state, long vibrational progressions are expected,
	in accord with experimental observations. For the keto-imine tautomer,
	a crossing of the 1$\pi\pi^*$ potential energy surface with the ground-state
	surface has been found, too. Its $n\pi^*$ minimum (3.27 {eV)} is
	located well below the conical intersection between the $\pi\pi^*$
	and S0 states, but it will be difficult to observe because of its
	small transition moment. The identified conical intersections of
	the $\pi\pi^*$ excited states of the keto cytosine tautomers are
	made responsible for the ultrafast decay to the electronic ground
	states and thus may explain their subpicoseconds lifetimes.},

  abstract = {A practical polarization propagator method devised for the treatment
	of valence electron excitations in atoms and molecules is presented.
	This method, referred to as (second-order) algebraic-diagrammatic
	construction (ADC(2)), allows for a theoretical description of single
	and double excitations consistently through second and first order,
	respectively, of perturbation theory. The computational scheme is
	essentially an eigenvalue problem of a Hermitian secular matrix defined
	with respect to the space of singly and doubly excited configurations.
	The configuration space is smaller (more compact) than that of comparable
	configuration interaction (CI) expansions and the method leads to
	size-consistent results. The performance of the ADC(2) method is
	tested in exemplary applications to Ne, Ar and CO, where detailed
	comparison can be made with experiment and previous theoretical results.
	While the accuracy of the absolute excitation energies is only moderate,
	a very satisfactory description is obtained for the relative energies
	and, in particular, for the spectral intensities. Aspects related
	to the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule and the equivalence of the dipole-length
	and dipole-velocity forms of the transition moments are discussed.
	Due to the relatively small computational expense and the possibility
	of a direct ADC(2) formulation this method should prove particularly
	useful in applications to large molecules.},

	states, according to probabilistic ''fewest switches'' algorithm.
	If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of
	the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy.
	The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among
	any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical
	probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations
	for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been
	specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical--quantal
	dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial

	(TU{,} BTU and TT{,} respectively) have been selected as target thionucleobases
	for the experimental studies and{,} in parallel{,} for DFT theoretical
	calculations. The UV spectra displayed by TU{,} BTU and TT in EtOH
	were very similar to each other. They showed a maximum around 275
	nm and a shoulder at ca. 290 nm. The three 2-TPyr exhibited a strong
	phosphorescence emission; from the recorded spectra{,} triplet excited
	state energies of ca. 307{,} 304 and 294 kJ mol-1 were determined
	for TU{,} BTU and TT{,} respectively. Laser excitation at 308 nm
	gave rise to a broad transient absorption band from 500 nm to 700
	nm{,} which was in principle assigned to triplet-triplet absorption.
	This assignment was confirmed by energy transfer experiments using
	biphenyl (ET = 274 kJ mol-1) as an acceptor. The triplet lifetimes
	were 70 ns{,} 1.1 [small mu ]s and 2.3 [small mu ]s{,} for TU{,}
	BTU and TT{,} respectively. The obtained photophysical data{,} both
	in phosphorescence and transient absorption measurements{,} point
	to significantly different properties of the TT triplet excited state
	in spite of the structural similarities. Theoretical calculations
	at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ/PCM level agree well with the experimental
	range of excited state energies and support the [small pi][small
	pi]* nature of the lowest triplet states.},

	resulted in the formation of the complexes [PtMe3(bpy)(SCy-?S)][BF4]
	(4) and [PtMe3(bpy)(1-MeSCy-?S)] [BF4] (5), respectively. The complexes
	were characterized by 1H and 13C \{NMR\} spectroscopy as well as
	by single-crystal X-ray analyses of MeOH and 5. In MeOH two strong
	hydrogen bonds (N4?H?N3?: N4?N3? 2.976(7)&#xa0;) between the thiocytosine
	ligands give rise to base pairing thus forming dinuclear cations
	[{PtMe3(bpy)(SCy-?S)}2]2+. In both complexes the platinum atom is
	octahedrally coordinated [PtC3N2S] by three methyl ligands, the 2,2?-bipyridine
	ligand and the ?S coordinated nucleobase (configuration index: OC-6-33).
	The structural investigations gave evidence that the sulfur atoms
	of the nucleobase ligands in MeOH and 5 have to be regarded as sp3
	and sp2 hybridized, respectively. Thus, the ligand in MeOH has to
	be considered as the deprotonated thiol-amino form of thiocytosine
	being reprotonated at N1. In complex 5 the 1-MeSCy is coordinated
	in its thione-amino form. DFT-calculations of the base-paired dinuclear

	the hydrogen bond (8.5&#xa0;kcal/mol) and exhibited that cation?anion

  abstract = {Our picture of reactions on electronically excited states has evolved
	considerably in recent years, due to advances in our understanding
	of points of degeneracy between different electronic states, termed
	{\textquotedblleft}conical intersections{\textquotedblright} {(CIs).}
	{CIs} serve as funnels for population transfer between different
	electronic states, and play a central role in ultrafast photochemistry.
	Because most practical photochemistry occurs in solution and protein
	environments, it is important to understand the role complex environments
	play in directing excited-state dynamics generally, as well as specific
	environmental effects on {CI} geometries and energies. In order to
	model such effects, we employ the full multiple spawning {(FMS)}
	method for multistate quantum dynamics, together with hybrid quantum
	mechanical/molecular mechanical {(QM/MM)} potential energy surfaces
	using both semiempirical and ab initio {QM} methods. In this article,
	we present an overview of these methods, and a comparison of the
	excited-state dynamics of several biological chromophores in solvent
	and protein environments. Aqueous solvation increases the rate of
	quenching to the ground state for both the photoactive yellow protein
	{(PYP)} and green fluorescent protein {(GFP)} chromophores, apparently
	by energetic stabilization of their respective {CIs.} In contrast,
	solvation in methanol retards the quenching process of the retinal
	protonated Schiff base {(RPSB),} the rhodopsin chromophore. Protein
	environments serve to direct the excited-state dynamics, leading
	to higher quantum yields and enhanced reaction selectivity.},

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions on the molecular (femtosecond) timescale
	typically uses pump laser pulses to excite molecules and subsequent
	probe pulses to interrogate them. The ultrashort pump pulse can excite
	only a small fraction of molecules, and the probe wavelength must
	be carefully chosen to discriminate between excited and unexcited
	molecules. The past decade has seen the emergence of new methods
	that are also aimed at imaging chemical reactions as they occur,
	based on X-ray diffraction1, electron diffraction2 or laser-induced
	recollision3, 4--with spectral selection not available for any of
	these new methods. Here we show that in the case of high-harmonic
	spectroscopy based on recollision, this apparent limitation becomes
	a major advantage owing to the coherent nature of the attosecond
	high-harmonic pulse generation. The coherence allows the unexcited
	molecules to act as local oscillators against which the dynamics
	are observed, so a transient grating technique5, 6 can be used to
	reconstruct the amplitude and phase of emission from the excited
	molecules. We then extract structural information from the amplitude,
	which encodes the internuclear separation, by quantum interference
	at short times and by scattering of the recollision electron at longer
	times. The phase records the attosecond dynamics of the electrons,
	giving access to the evolving ionization potentials and the electronic
	structure of the transient molecule. In our experiment, we are able
	to document a temporal shift of the high-harmonic field of less than
	an attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) between the stretched and compressed
	geometry of weakly vibrationally excited Br2 in the electronic ground
	state. The ability to probe structural and electronic features, combined
	with high time resolution, make high-harmonic spectroscopy ideally
	suited to measuring coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring
	in photochemical reactions and to characterizing the electronic structure
	of transition states.},

  abstract = {The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is caused
	by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, is increasing.
	With regard to genetic factors, variations in the gene encoding Cdk5
	regulatory associated protein 1âlike 1 (Cdkal1) have been associated
	with an impaired insulin response and increased risk of T2D across
	different ethnic populations, but the molecular function of this
	protein has not been characterized. Here, we show that Cdkal1 is
	a mammalian methylthiotransferase that biosynthesizes 2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine
	(ms2t6A) in tRNALys(UUU) and that it is required for the accurate
	translation of AAA and AAG codons. Mice with pancreatic Î² cellâspecific
	KO of Cdkal1 (referred to herein as Î² cell KO mice) showed pancreatic
	islet hypertrophy, a decrease in insulin secretion, and impaired
	blood glucose control. In Cdkal1-deficient Î² cells, misreading of
	Lys codon in proinsulin occurred, resulting in a reduction of glucose-stimulated
	proinsulin synthesis. Moreover, expression of ER stressârelated genes
	was upregulated in these cells, and abnormally structured ER was
	observed. Further, the Î² cell KO mice were hypersensitive to high
	fat dietâinduced ER stress. These findings suggest that glucose-stimulated
	translation of proinsulin may require fully modified tRNALys(UUU),
	which could potentially explain the molecular pathogenesis of T2D
	in patients carrying cdkal1 risk alleles.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of {RI-MP2} first derivatives with respect to nuclear
	coordinates or with respect to an external electric field is described.
	The prefix {RI} indicates the use of an approximate resolution of
	identity in the Hilbert space of interacting charge distributions
	{(Coulomb} metric), i.e., the use of an auxiliary basis set to approximate
	charge distributions. The {RI} technique is applied to first derivatives
	of the {MP2} correlation energy expression while the (restricted)
	{Hartree-Fock} reference is treated in the usual way. Computational
	savings by a factor of 10 over conventional approaches are demonstrated
	in an application to porphyrin. It is shown that the {RI} approximation
	to {MP2} derivatives does not entail any significant loss in accuracy.
	Finally, the relative energetic stabilities of a representative sample
	of closed-shell molecules built from first and second row elements
	have been investigated by the {RI-MP2} approach, and thus it is tested
	whether such properties that refer to potential energy hypersurfaces
	in a more global way can be described with similar consistency to
	the more locally defined derivatives.},

  abstract = {A new internally contracted direct multiconfiguration--reference configuration
	interaction {(MRCI)} method is described which allows the use of
	much larger reference spaces than any previous {MRCI} method. The
	configurations with two electrons in the external orbital space are
	generated by applying pair excitation operators to the reference
	wave function as a whole, while the singly external and internal
	configurations are standard uncontracted spin eigenfunctions. A new
	efficient and simple method for the calculation of the coupling coefficients
	is used, which is well suited for vector machines, and allows the
	recalculation of all coupling coefficients each time they are needed.
	The vector H$\cdot$c is computed partly in a nonorthogonal configuration
	basis. In order to test the accuracy of the internally contracted
	wave functions, benchmark calculations have been performed for F-,
	{H2O}, {NH2}, {CH2}, {CH3}, {OH}, {NO}, N2, and O2 at various geometries.
	The deviations of the energies obtained with internally contracted
	and uncontracted {MRCI} wave functions are mostly smaller than 1
	{mH} and typically 3--5 times smaller than the deviations between
	the uncontracted {MRCI} and the full {CI.} Dipole moments, electric
	dipole polarizabilities, and electronic dipole transition moments
	calculated with uncontracted and contracted {MRCI} wave functions
	also are found to be in close agreement. The efficiency of the method
	is demonstrated in large scale calculations for the {CN}, {NH3},
	{CO2}, and Cr2 molecules. In these calculations up to 3088 reference
	configurations and up to 154 orbitals were employed. The biggest
	calculation is equivalent to an uncontracted {MRCI} with more than
	78 million configurations.},

  abstract = {An efficient direct {CI} method which includes all singly and doubly
	substituted configurations with respect to an arbitrary multiconfiguration
	{(MCSCF)} reference function is described. The configurations are
	generated by subsequently applying spin-coupled two-particle annihilation
	and creation operators to the complete {MCSCF} function. This considerably
	reduces the size of the n-electron basis and the computational effort
	as compared to previous multireference {CI} treatments, in which
	the configurations are defined with respect to the individual reference
	configurations. The formalism of the method is very similar to the
	closed-shell ''self-consistent electron pairs'' {(SCEP)} method of
	Meyer. The vector Hc is obtained in terms of simple matrix operations
	involving coefficient and integral matrices. A full transformation
	of the two-electron integrals is not required. Test calculations
	with large basis sets have been performed for the {3B1} and {1A1}
	states of {CH2} {($\Delta$E} = 9.5 kcal/mol) and for the {CH2(3B1)}
	{+H2$\rightarrow$CH3+H} reaction barrier {($\Delta$E} = 10.7 kcal/mol).
	As a preliminary test for the accuracy of the results obtained with
	contracted wave functions of the above type the potential energy
	and dipole moment functions of the {OH} X 2$\Pi$ and A 2$\Sigma$+
	states have been calculated. For the 2$\Pi$ state re and $\omega$e
	deviate by less than 10-3 \AA and 1 cm-1, respectively, from the
	experimental data. For the 2$\Sigma$+ state the agreement is somewhat
	less good, which is probably due to basis set defects. Around the
	equilibrium distance the calculated dipole moment functions are in
	very close agreement with those previously obtained from {PNO--}
	{CEPA} functions.},

  abstract = {A new concept is proposed for an optical probe with spatial resolution
	unlimited by diffraction effects. It is based on optical-field confinement
	by surface plasmons of a submicrometer-sized metal particle. The
	particle serves as an antenna that receives an incoming electromagnetic
	field. The field extends to a nearby sample surface and interacts
	with a small area on that surface through the nonlinear susceptibility
	tensors. The induced sample polarization is reradiated by the particle,
	thereby generating a Raman, a two-photon, or a second-harmonic spectrum.
	Microscopy is performed by rastering the position of the metal particle
	over the sample surface. Spatial resolution approaching 1 nm is projected.
	The concept is also applicable to submicrometer optical lithography
	and ultrahighdensity optical recording.},

  abstract = {A variational method has been used to calculate the low-lying vibration-rotation
	energy levels of various triatomic molecules. The wavefunctions were
	expanded as a linear combination of products of polynomials of the
	normal coordinates multipled by suitable spherical harmonics of the
	Euler angles. The molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonians given
	by Watson for nonlinear (1) and linear (2) molecules were employed.
	Using numerical integration, the method can be applied to any molecule
	for any form of the potential surface.
	
	Calculations have been carried out on the nonlinear triatomics {H2O}
	and {SO2} and the linear system {OCS.} Potential-energy surfaces
	expressed in terms of variables $\Delta$r12, $\Delta$r13, and $\Delta$$\Theta$,
	where $\Delta$r represents a change in bond length and $\Delta$$\Theta$
	a change in bond angle, have been derived by many workers using perturbation
	theory and potential functions of this form were used in the calculations.
	The results for {H2O} indicate that none of the surfaces employed
	are satisfactory. For the best surface, although the band origin
	for the (000)-(010) transition is within 4 cm-1 of the experimental
	value, the band origins for the (000)-(100) and (000)-(001) transitions
	are in error by at least 60 cm-1. The results for {SO2} are much
	closer to experiment, which indicates that perturbation theory is
	more accurate for the potential surface determination in this case.
	The results for {OCS} are similarly much closer to the experimental
	values.
	
	This variational method is recommended as a means of investigating
	the quality of potential surfaces.},

  abstract = {Motivated originally by the goal of steering a photoreaction into
	desired product channels, the concept of coherent control is to adapt
	the spectral and temporal characteristics of the excitation light
	to the inherent molecular resonances and dynamics, such that these
	can be selectively addressed and manipulated. In the last decade,
	the ultrafast dynamics of many atomic and molecular quantum systems
	in the gas and condensed phase have been controlled successfully.
	Motivations in chemistry are now 1) to perform spectroscopy by coherent
	control, which requires a deeper understanding of control mechanisms,
	2) to treat more complex, biological photoreactions, and 3) the pragmatic
	use of coherent control techniques, for example, for pulse compression
	or enhanced contrast in multiphoton microscopy. As examples for 1)
	and 2) we review here the combined effort and interplay of conventional
	spectroscopy and coherent control experiments, applied to the energy
	flow in the light-harvesting complex {LH2} from bacterial photosynthesis.
	Closed-loop control experiments allowed the characteristic coupling
	frequency of internal conversion in the carotenoid in {LH2} to be
	extracted. Open-loop three-pulse control experiments, on the other
	hand, could directly observe an anticipated Raman-excited carotenoid
	ground state. As a variant of difference spectroscopy, coherent control
	has thus served to gain complementary spectroscopic knowledge about
	the energy flow in carotenoids by comparing natural to manipulated
	dynamics. Finally, we propose future coherent control experiments
	on the electronic state structure of carotenoids and discuss prospects
	of coherent control for other biological chromophores.},

	present a joint approach comparing time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
	(TRPES) with ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) simulations on the
	MS-MR-CASPT2 level of theory. We disentangle the relationship between
	two phenomena that dominate the immediate molecular response upon
	light absorption: a spectrally dependent delay of the photoelectron
	signal and an induction time prior to excited state depopulation
	in dynamics simulations. As a benchmark molecule{,} we have chosen
	hexamethylcyclopentadiene{,} which shows an unprecedentedly large
	spectral delay of (310 +/- 20) fs in TRPES experiments. For the dynamics
	simulations{,} methyl groups were replaced by {"}hydrogen atoms{"}
	having mass 15 and TRPES spectra were calculated. These showed an
	induction time of (108 +/- 10) fs which could directly be assigned
	to progress along a torsional mode leading to the intersection seam
	with the molecular ground state. In a stepladder-type approach{,}
	the close connection between the two phenomena could be elucidated{,}

	could be interpreted as Fermi doublets. However, assuming 2-thiocytosine
	to be a non-planar molecule, splitting of all the frequencies could
	be very well explained. A possible explanation could be the non-planarity
	of the pyrimidine ring and non-planarity at the nitrogen site of
	the amino group which might cause splitting of the frequencies into
	two components. Non-equivalence of the two \{NH\} bonds of the \{NH2\}
	group suggests a difference in the strengths of the two hydrogen
	bonds. Lowering of the CS stretching frequency for 2-thiocytosine
	compared to 2-thiouracil by 19 cm1 gives an indication of the involvement
	of the sulphur atom of the former in the hydrogen bonding.},

  abstract = {The development of cyclometalated Ir(iii) complexes has enabled important
	breakthroughs in electroluminescence because such complexes permit
	the efficient population of triplet excited states that give rise
	to luminescent transitions. The triplet states of Ir(iii) complexes
	are advantageous over those of other transition metal complexes in
	that their electronic transitions and charge-transfer characteristics
	are tunable over wide ranges. These favorable properties suggest
	that Ir(iii) complexes have significant potential in a variety of
	photofunctions other than electroluminescence. In this critical review{,}
	we describe recent photonic applications of novel Ir(iii) complexes.
	Ir(iii) complexes have been shown to affect the exciton statistics
	in the active layers of organic photovoltaic cells{,} thereby improving
	the photon-to-current conversion efficiencies. Nonlinear optical
	applications that take advantage of the strong charge-transfer properties
	of triplet transitions are also discussed. The tunability of the
	electrochemical potentials facilitates the development of efficient
	photocatalysis in the context of water photolysis or organic syntheses.
	The photoredox reactivities of Ir(iii) complexes have been employed
	in studies of charge migration along DNA chains. The photoinduced
	cytotoxicity of Ir(iii) complexes on live cells suggests that the
	complexes may be useful in photodynamic therapy. Potential biological
	applications of the complexes include phosphorescence labeling and
	sensing. Intriguing platforms based on cyclometalated Ir(iii) complexes
	potentially provide novel protein tagging and ratiometric detection.
	We envision that future research into the photofunctionality of Ir(iii)
	complexes will provide important breakthroughs in a variety of photonic
	applications.},

	2-Thiouridine was readily converted to acid-soluble nucleotides which
	were identified as thio-UMP, thio-UDP, and thio-UTP. Identification
	of the latter two thionucleotides was based on chromatographic characteristics
	on anion-exchange columns and thin-layer plates as well as the nature
	of the products formed after partial degradation. Two thio-UDP-conjugates,
	thio-UDP-glucose and thio-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, were also identified
	by similar methods and by the incorporation of radioactive carbohydrate.
	The formation of thio-UDP-glucuronic acid was also suggested. [2-14C]Thiouridine
	was also incorporated into rat liver \{RNA\} and the radioactivity
	in \{RNA\} hydrolyzates, chromatographed on anion-exchange columns
	and thin-layer plates, was coincidental with authentic thio-UMP.
	Thus, it appears that pathways exist in mammalian cells by which
	thiouracil can be incorporated into thionucleotides, thio-UDP-conjugates,
	and RNA. The similarities in the metabolites formed from uridine
	and thiouridine suggest that the pathways for incorporation of thiouridine
	into thio-UDP conjugates and \{RNA\} are identical or at least strikingly
	similar to those utilizing uridine. },

	of the {?3B1} state with v3 = 1 and as direct transitions to the
	{b?3A2} state, which both become allowed in the lower symmetry. The
	?3 frequency of the {?3B1} state of {18OS16O} is 922 cm-1; for the

	the measurement of dispersed phosphorescence spectra {(?3B1-X?1A1)}
	in the wavelength region 387.5?526.3 nm (19 000?25?800 cm-1). The

	shifted 18 cm-1 to the red from the gas phase; the three vibrational
	frequencies of the X? state are nearly unperturbed in the neon matrix
	(1149, 520, and 1362 cm-1). As the zero-phonon lines are sharp and
	well resolved, it has been possible to monitor emission from a specific

	of matrix-isolated {16OS16O} and {18OS18O} in the region 350.9?388.5
	nm (25?740?28?500 cm-1) are similar to those previously observed
	in the gas phase, with strong perturbations affecting all vibrational
	levels above {?3B1(110)} at 27?005 cm-1 (370 nm). Two additional

	through a barrierless state switch from the initially excited 1$\pi\pi^*$
	state to the out-of-plane deformed excited state of biradical character,

	nonradiative decay mechanism predicts that replacement of the C5

	does not. These predictions are borne out by the very different fluorescence

	characterized, no self-replicating genetic material is yet available.
	Nonenzymatic template-directed synthesis of RNA with activated ribonucleotide
	monomers has led to the copying of short RNA templates; however,
	these reactions are generally slow (taking days to weeks) and highly
	error prone. N3â²-P5â²âlinked phosphoramidate DNA (3â²-NP-DNA) is similar
	to RNA in its overall duplex structure, and is attractive as an alternative
	to RNA because the high reactivity of its corresponding monomers
	allows rapid and efficient copying of all four nucleobases on homopolymeric
	RNA and DNA templates. Here we show that both homopolymeric and mixed-sequence
	3â²-NP-DNA templates can be copied into complementary 3â²-NP-DNA sequences.
	G:T and A:C wobble pairing leads to a high error rate, but the modified
	nucleoside 2-thiothymidine suppresses wobble pairing. We show that
	the 2-thiothymidine modification increases both polymerization rate
	and fidelity in the copying of a 3â²-NP-DNA template into a complementary
	strand of 3â²-NP-DNA. Our results suggest that 3â²-NP-DNA has the potential
	to serve as the genetic material of artificial biological systems.},

	radiation, and UVA-mediated photochemical damage of \{DNA\} 6-TG
	has potentially harmful side effects. When free 6-TG is \{UVA\} irradiated
	in solution in the presence of molecular oxygen, reactive oxygen
	species are generated and 6-TG is oxidized to guanine-6-sulfonate
	(GSO3) and guanine-6-thioguanine in reactions involving singlet oxygen.
	This conversion is prevented by antioxidants, including the dietary
	vitamin ascorbate. \{DNA\} \{GSO3\} is also the major photoproduct
	of 6-TG in \{DNA\} and it can be selectively introduced into \{DNA\}
	or oligonucleotides in vitro by mild chemical oxidation. Thermal

  abstract = {We present two new hybrid meta exchange- correlation functionals,
	called M06 and M06-2X. The M06 functional is parametrized including
	both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional
	is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal
	exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals.The functionals,
	along with the previously published M06-L local functional and the
	M06-HF full-Hartree--Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of
	complementary functionals. We assess these four functionals by comparing
	their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree--Fock
	theory for 403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including
	ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight
	databases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition
	metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation energies, and
	three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate
	the performance of these 17 methods for three databases containing
	40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies
	and 15 vibrational zero point energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional
	for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics,
	noncovalent interactions, and electronic excitation energies to valence
	and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application
	in organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent
	interactions.},
