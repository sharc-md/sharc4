  abstract = {The reaction mechanism of olefin metathesis by ruthenium carbene catalysts
	is studied by gradient-corrected density functional calculations
	({BP86).} Alternative reaction mechanisms for the reaction of the
	?first-generation? Grubbs-type catalyst ({PCy3)2Cl2RuCH2} (1) for
	the reaction with ethylene are studied. The most likely dissociative
	mechanism with trans olefin coordination is investigated for the
	metathesis reaction between the ?first-? and the ?second-generation?
	Grubbs-type catalysts 1 and ({H2IMes)(PCy3)Cl2RuCH2} (2) with different
	substrates, ethylene, ethyl vinyl ether, and norbornene, and a profound
	influence of the substrate is found. In contrast to the degenerate
	reaction with ethylene, the reactions with ethyl vinyl ether and
	norbornene are strongly exergonic by 8?15 kcal/mol, and this excess
	energy is released after passing through the metallacyclobutane structure.
	While the metallacyclobutane is in a deep potential minimum for degenerate
	metathesis reactions, the energy barrier for the [2+2] cycloreversion
	vanishes for the most exergonic reactions. On the free energy surface
	under typical experimental conditions, the rate-limiting steps for
	the overall reactions are then either metallacyclobutane formation
	for 1 or phosphane ligand dissociation for 2.},

	are subject to nonadiabatic evolution, via either internal conversion
	({IC)} back to the ground state or mutagenesis. Nonadiabatic processes
	following the formation of the first singlet excited states, S1,
	in 10 different small {DNA} fragments?4 single {4?H-nucleosides},
	2 {Watson?Crick} base pairs, and 4 nucleotide quartets?have been
	investigated. Simulations were done via the nonadiabatic direct trajectory
	surface hopping semiclassical dynamics. The electronic wave function
	was obtained with configuration interaction, based on the semiempirical
	{AM1} and {PM3} Hamiltonians with fractional orbital occupation numbers.
	The evolution of the electronic wave function was governed by the
	time-dependent Schro?dinger equation with a locally diabatic representation,
	intrinsically stable near surface crossings. The nuclei evolved on
	adiabatic potential energy surfaces, as prescribed by classical Newtonian
	dynamics, with sudden hops between potential energy surfaces to account
	for nonadiabatic transitions. The ?fewest switches? surface hopping
	algorithm coupled the quantum and classical parts of the system.
	The dynamics simulations revealed several routes of nonadiabatic
	relaxation in these systems, which were not reported previously,
	and also recovered known routes of {IC.}},

	the conventional cascade model, where {ISC} rates are slower than

	couplings are strong. Consequently, ultrafast {ISC} between these

  abstract = {The {Born--Oppenheimer} treatment leads to the adiabatic framework
	where the non-adiabatic terms are the physical entities responsible
	for the coupling between adiabatic states. The main disadvantage
	of this treatment is in the fact that these coupling terms frequently
	become singular thus causing difficulties in solving the relevant
	Schroedinger equation for the motion of the nuclei that make up the
	molecular systems. In this review, we present the line integral approach
	which enables the formation of the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation
	matrix that yields the friendlier diabatic framework. The review
	concentrates on the mathematical conditions that allow the rigorous
	derivation of the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation matrix and
	its interesting physical properties. One of the findings of this
	study is that the non-adiabatic coupling terms have to be quantized
	in a certain manner in order to yield single-valued diabatic potentials.
	Another important feature revealed is the existence of the topological
	matrix, which contains all the topological features of a given molecular
	system related to a closed contour in configuration space. Finally,
	we present an approximation that results from the {Born--Oppenheimer}
	treatment which, in contrast to the original {Born--Oppenheimer}
	approximation, contains the effect of the non-adiabatic coupling
	terms. The various derivations are accompanied by examples which
	in many cases are interesting by themselves.},

	the polarizable continuum model; the reliability of {TD-M052X} is
	checked against {CASPT2} calculations regarding the behavior of two

	the main absorption band leads to cyclobutane dimers (T{\textless}{\textgreater}Ts)
	and (6-4) adducts via different electronic excited states. T{\textless}{\textgreater}Ts
	are formed via $^1\pi\pi^*$ excitons; [2 + 2] dimerization proceeds
	along a barrierless path, in line with the constant quantum yield
	(0.05) with the irradiation wavelength, the contribution of the $^3\pi\pi^*$
	state to this reaction being less than 10\%. The formation of oxetane,
	the reaction intermediate leading to (6-4) adducts, occurs via charge
	transfer excited states involving two stacked thymines, whose fingerprint
	is detected in the fluorescence spectra; it involves an energy barrier

	tool to be used in connection with a multitude of third-party electronic-structure
	program packages and (2) to provide the most common options for excited-state
	dynamics simulations. Benchmark calculations on the nonadiabatic

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a new semiclassical method for simulating
	femtosecond pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy, and its implementation
	to study the excited state photodissociation dynamics of the $I^-_2$
	anion. Our algorithm involves a forward-backward {(FB)} semiclassical
	{(SC)} initial value representation {(IVR)} method for calculating
	the time dependent photodetachment spectrum P($\varepsilon$,$\Delta$t)
	as a function of the kinetic energy $\varepsilon$ of the photodetached
	electron and the delay time $\Delta$t between the pump and probe
	pulses. We describe the radiation-chromophore interaction perturbatively
	to first order in both pulse fields, assuming the Condon approximation
	for the electronic transition dipole moments. Our computed spectra
	are in excellent agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations.

	{(MCTDH)} method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	{MCTDH} may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with {MCTDH} to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all
	24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the {MCTDH} wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the {MCTDH}
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	{(CDVR)} method, is also briefly discussed.},

	in steady-state and time-resolved experiments and theoretically by

	show that replacement of the C5 hydrogen of cytosine by fluorine
	increases the excited-state lifetime by 2 orders of magnitude from
	720 fs to 73 $\pm$ 4 ps. Experimental evidence indicates that emission
	in both compounds originates from a single tautomeric form. The lifetime
	of {5FC} is the same within experimental uncertainty in the solvents
	ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide. The insensitivity of the S1 lifetime
	to the protic nature of the solvent suggests that proton transfer
	is not the principal quenching mechanism for the excited state. Excited-state
	calculations were carried out for the amino-keto tautomer of {5FC},
	the dominant species in polar environments, in order to understand
	its longer excited-state lifetime. {CASSCF} and {CAS?PT2} calculations
	of the excited states show that the minimum energy path connecting
	the minimum of the $^1\pi\pi^*$ state with the conical intersection
	responsible for internal conversion has essentially the same energetics
	for cytosine and {5FC}, suggesting that both bases decay nonradiatively
	by the same mechanism. The dramatic difference in lifetimes may be
	due to subtle changes along the decay coordinate. A possible reason
	may be differences in the intramolecular vibrational redistribution
	rate from the {Franck?Condon} active, in-plane modes to the out-of-plane
	modes that must be activated to reach the conical intersection region.},

	($\pi\pi^*$) and ($n_O\pi^*$) singlet excited states of cytosine
	is the topological feature that dominates the ultrafast decay of
	singlet excited cytosine. The three-state intersection is associated
	with seams of intersection between pairs of states ({S1/S0} and {S2/S1},
	respectively), and the resulting topology has been mapped out with
	{CASSCF} and {CAS-PT2} calculations. The minimum-energy path for
	the optically active ($\pi\pi^*$) state lies on the S1 surface, and
	decay to the ground state takes place at the {S1/S0} seam. On the
	other hand, the region of the {S2/S1} seam must be traversed before
	accessing the conical intersection with the ground state and recrossing
	to S2 becomes possible. Another feature associated with the three-state
	degeneracy is vibronic coupling between the ($\pi\pi^*$) and ($n_O\pi^*$)
	excited states (proximity effect), which lowers the barrier to the
	{S1/S0} seam. From a mechanistic point of view, then, the decay is
	the outcome of the interaction between the three states. The results
	also suggest that the experimental excited-state lifetime is the
	effect of two factors, an energetically accessible region of {S1/S0}
	degeneracy and a region where the decay can be slowed because of
	recrossing to S2.},

  abstract = {Eight bands of the 2350 \AA system of sulfur dioxide have been rotationally
	analyzed as A-type transitions of a prolate asymmetric rotor, confirming
	that the electronic transition is {1B2} \$\leftarrow$ {1A1[2b1($\pi$*)}
	\$\leftarrow$ 1a2($\pi$)]. The electronic energy and rotational constants
	of the 0-0 band are, in cm-1: {T042573.450$\pm$0.005$\delta$J(0.041$\pm$0.05)10-5,A0001.15053$\pm$0.00014$\delta$JK(1.34$\pm$0.04)10-5,B0000.34744$\pm$0.00002$\delta$K(0.73$\pm$0.09)10-5,C0000.26543$\pm$0.00002$\delta$J(0.009$\pm$0.003)10-5,$\delta$(u\AA20.339$\pm$0.005$\delta$K(0.42$\pm$0.21)10-5}
	These constants correspond to the average structure r0 = 1.560 \AA
	and $\Theta$0 = 104.3$^\circ$. However, the vibrational structure
	can only be satisfactorily accounted for on the hypothesis of a double-minimum
	potential in the antisymmetrical stretching coordinate Q3, the energies
	of the fundamental levels in the three modes of the B2 state being:
	(100), 960 cm-1; (010), 377 cm-1; and (001), ~220 cm-1 The (001)
	level is not observed in the spectrum but can be calculated from
	the distortion constants and inertial defect of the rotational analysis:
	the level (002) = 561 cm-1, obtained directly from the vibrational
	structure, establishes that there is strong, positive anharmonicity
	in the first three levels of this vibration, as required by the assumption
	of a double-minimum potential function. Preliminary values are reported
	for the barrier to the symmetrical configuration, Vhc ~ 100 cm-1,
	and for the difference in bond distances in the equilibrium configuration,
	$\Delta$r$\simeq$0.12 \AA. Coon and his co-workers have previously
	considered the possible asymmetry of this state but the Q3 inversion
	barrier obtained by them, 656 cm-1, is much higher than in the present
	work, and reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {An evaluation has been made of the existing kinetic data related to
	the elementary, homogeneous reactions of {SO2} within the troposphere.
	A set of preferred values of the rate constants for these reactions
	is presented. Simulations using these data provide significant new
	evidence that the oxidation of {SO2} can occur at substantial rates
	through these homogenous reaction paths. The direct photo-oxidation
	of {SO2} by way of the electronically excited states of {SO2} is
	relatively unimportant for most conditions which occur within the
	troposphere. The oxidation of {SO2} within the natural troposphere
	is expected to occur largely by way of reactions 39, 31 and 33, with
	reaction 39 being the dominant path: {HO} + {SO2} (+ M) {$\rightarrow$HOSO2}
	( + M) (39); {HO2} + {SO2} $\rightarrow$ {HO} + {SO3} (31); {CH3O2}
	+ {SO2$\rightarrow$CH3O} + {SO3} (33). By combining our kinetic estimates
	with the Crutzen and Fishman calculation of {[HO]}, {[HO2]} and {[CH3O2]}
	for the troposphere, we estimate that the total rates of {SO2} oxidation
	as high as 1.5\%h-1 are expected at midday in July in the midlatitudes.
	Theoretical estimates of the monthly rates averaged over the northern
	hemisphere vary from a low of 0.1 \%h-1 in January to a maximum of
	about 0.2\% h-1 in July. From our computer simulations of the reactions
	within an {SO2}, {NOx}, hydrocarbon, {CO}, aldehyde-polluted lower
	troposphere, it is predicted that the three reactions, 39. 31 and
	33 occur with about equal rates; {SO2} oxidations for this case can
	proceed homogeneously at rates as high as 4\% h-1. Considerations
	of the reactions in stack gas plumes suggest that a small maximum
	in the {SO2} photo-oxidation rate may occur during the early stages
	of the dispersion of a parcel of the stack gases into the air. This
	should be followed by a short period of slower oxidation. In theory
	the initial burst is expected to arise from {NO2} and {HONO} photolysis
	followed by reaction 39 and the reaction. O {(3P)} + {SO2} (+ M)$\rightarrow$
	{SO3} (+ M). After the extensive dilution of the stack gases by polluted
	urban air, the rate of {SO2} homogeneous oxidation is expected to
	approach that for a typical polluted urban atmosphere ({\textasciitilde}4\%h-1).},

	were investigated using mass-selected femtosecond resolved pump-probe
	resonant ionization. By comparison between nucleobases and methylated
	species, in which tautomerism cannot occur, we can access intrinsic
	mechanisms at a time resolution never reported so far (80 fs). At
	this time resolution, and using appropriate substitution, real nuclear
	motion corresponding to active vibrational modes along deactivation
	coordinates can actually be probed. We provide evidence for the existence
	of a two-step decay mechanism, following a 267 nm excitation of the
	nucleobases. The time resolution achieved together with a careful
	zero time-delay calibration between lasers allow us to show that
	the first step does correspond to intrinsic dynamics rather than
	to a laser cross correlation. For adenine and 9-methyladenine a first
	decay component of about 100 fs has been measured. This first step
	is radically increased to 200 fs when the amino group hydrogen atoms
	of adenine are substituted by methyl groups. Our results could be
	rationalized according to the effect of the highly localized nature
	of the excitation combined to the presence of efficient deactivation
	pathway along both pyrimidine ring and amino group out-of-plane vibrational
	modes. These nuclear motions play a key role in the vibronic coupling
	between the initially excited $\pi\pi^*$ and the dark $n\pi^*$ states.
	This seems to be the common mechanism that opens up the earlier phase
	of the internal conversion pathway which then, in consideration of
	the rather fast relaxation times observed, would probably proceed
	via conical intersection between the $n\pi^*$ relay state and high
	vibrational levels of the ground state.},

	nearly complete electronic population inversion of molecular systems
	can be achieved with intense positively chirped broadband laser pulses.
	To provide a simple physical picture, a two-level model is used to
	examine the condition for the so-called $\pi$ pulses and a four-level
	model is designed to demonstrate for molecular systems the correlation
	between the sign of the chirp and the excited state population. The
	proposed molecular $\pi$ pulse is the combined result of vibrational
	coherence in the femtosecond regime and adiabatic inversion in the
	picosecond regime. Numerical results for a displaced oscillator,
	for {LiH} and for I2, show that the proposed molecular $\pi$ pulse
	scheme is robust with respect to changes in field parameters such
	as the linear positive chirp rate, field intensity, bandwidth, and
	carrier frequency, and is stable with respect to thermal and condensed
	phase conditions including molecular rotation, rovibronic coupling,
	and electronic dephasing. \copyright\ 2000 American Institute of

	In agreement with experiments {PCy3} coordinates more strongly to

	Moreover, ethene coordination and insertion into the Ru?alkylidene
	bond in the above-mentioned systems, as well as in the Hofmann type
	catalytic system with a cis-coordinated phosphane ligand, has been
	studied. The calculated insertion barrier for the {NHC} systems are
	lower than that of the ({PCy3)2Cl2RuCHPh} system. This is consistent

	(2) and 5-bromo-2?-deoxycytidine (3) with N?-acetyl-l-tryptophan
	N-ethylamide (4) in aqueous buffered (pH 7) solutions were studied.
	These photoreactions led to N?-acetyl-2-(cytosin-5-yl)tryptophan
	N-ethylamide (1a), N?-acetyl-2-(1-methylcytosin-5-yl)tryptophan N-ethylamide
	(2a) and N?-acetyl-2-[1-(2-deoxy-?-l-erythro-pentofuranosyl)cytosin-5-yl]trypophan
	N-ethylamide (3a) respectively as the main photoproducts. Thus the
	coupling observed was regiospecific between the 5 position of cytosine
	and the 2 position of the indole ring of 4. The structure of the
	photoproducts was established by spectroscopic methods (1H and 13C
	nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, \{UV\} spectroscopy,
	electron impact and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry); in the
	case of 1a, additional confirmatory evidence was obtained by a chemical
	method (the diazotization reaction of 1a with sodium nitrite and
	acetic acid to give N?-acetyl-2-(uracil-5-yl)tryptophanN-ethylamide).
	The quantum yields of formation of the cytosine-tryptophan adducts
	1a?3a ranged from 3.9 x 10?3 to 5.4 x 10?3. The formation of cross-links
	of the type proposed here between 5-bromocytosine-substituted \{DNA\}
	and proteins may be detected by the characteristic fluorescence emission
	of the cytosine-tryptophan fluorophore. The mechanism of formation
	of the photoproducts 1a?3a is proposed to involve electrophilic attack
	of the 5-cytosinyl cation on the indole ring of 4. },

	intersystem crossing effects in the title reaction. The time-dependent
	wave-packet method, combined with an extended split operator scheme,
	is used to calculate the fine-structure resolved cross section. The
	calculation involves four electronic potential-energy surfaces of
	the state [ J. Dobbyn and P. J. Knowles, Faraday Discuss. 110, 247
	(1998)] , the and the two degenerate states [ S. Rogers, D. Wang,

	calculations clearly demonstrate that the spin--orbit coupling between
	the triplet states of different symmetries has the greatest contribution
	to the intersystem crossing, whereas the singlet-triplet coupling
	is not an important effect. A branch ratio of the spin state $\Pi$3/2
	to $\Pi$1/2 of the product {OH} was calculated to be ~ 2.75, with
	collision energy higher than 0.6 {eV}, when the wave packet was initially

	metal complexes using a search space constrained around chemically
	meaningful structures assembled from three kinds of fragments: a
	part shared by all structures and typically containing the metal
	center itself, one or several parts consisting of ligand skeletons,
	and unconstrained parts that may grow and vary freely. In {EA} optimizations,
	using a cost-efficient fitness function based on a linear quantitative
	structure?activity relationship model for catalytic activity, we
	demonstrate the capabilities of the method by retracing the transition
	from the first-generation, phosphine-based Grubbs olefin metathesis
	catalysts to second-generation catalysts containing N-heterocyclic
	carbene ligands instead of phosphines. Moreover, {DFT} calculations
	on selected high-fitness, last-generation structures from these evolutionary
	experiments suggest that, in terms of catalytic activity, the structures
	arrived at by virtual evolution alone compare favorably with existing,
	highly active catalysts. The structures from the evolution experiments
	are, however, complex and probably difficult to synthesize, but a
	set of manually simplified variations thereof might form the leads
	for a new generation of Grubbs catalysts.},

	in air has been investigated using natural sunlight as a light source.
	The concentration of gaseous {SO2} and of sulphur-containing aerosol
	was monitored both in the dark and in sunlight using radioactive
	{35SO2} and the rate of photochemical reaction was determined from
	the decay of {SO2} and the yield of aerosol. Following other workers,
	we believe that the sulphur containing aerosol formed consists of
	sulphuric acid droplets. The aerosol measurements gave a photochemical
	conversion rate of {SO2} of up to 0.65 per cent per hour and values
	at least as high as this may be expected in the atmosphere. High
	conversion rates determined from the decay of {SO2} (up to 100 per
	cent per hour) are believed to be unrealistic due to a reaction on
	the chamber walls.
	
	The observed conversion rates from the aerosol measurements were considerably
	higher than the widely accepted value of 0.1 per cent per hour. It
	is suggested that the participation in the photochemical reaction
	of trace impurities in the ambient air may account for this.},

  abstract = {Solar ultraviolet light creates excited electronic states in {DNA}
	that can decay to mutagenic photoproducts. This vulnerability is
	compensated for in all organisms by enzymatic repair of photodamaged
	{DNA.} As repair is energetically costly, {DNA} is intrinsically
	photostable. Single bases eliminate electronic energy non-radiatively
	on a subpicosecond timescale, but base stacking and base pairing
	mediate the decay of excess electronic energy in the double helix
	in poorly understood ways. In the past, considerable attention has
	been paid to excited base pairs. Recent reports have suggested that
	light-triggered motion of a proton in one of the hydrogen bonds of
	an isolated base pair initiates non-radiative decay to the electronic
	ground state. Here we show that vertical base stacking, and not base
	pairing, determines the fate of excited singlet electronic states
	in single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of adenine
	(A) and thymine (T) bases. Intrastrand excimer states with lifetimes
	of 50-150 ps are formed in high yields whenever A is stacked with
	itself or with T. Excimers limit excitation energy to one strand
	at a time in the B-form double helix, enabling repair using the undamaged
	strand as a template.},

  abstract = {Excited states of the double-stranded {DNA} model (A)12$\cdot$(T)12
	were calculated in the framework of the Frenkel exciton theory. The
	off-diagonal elements of the exciton matrix were calculated using
	the transition densities and ideal dipole approximation associated
	with the lowest energy $\pi\pi^*$ excitations of the individual nucleobases
	as obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations.
	The values of the coupling calculated with the transition density
	cubes ({TDC)} and ideal dipole approximation ({IDA)} methods were
	found to be significantly different for the small interchromophore
	distances. It was shown that the {IDA} overestimates the coupling
	significantly. The effects of structural fluctuations of the {DNA}
	chain on the magnitude of dipolar coupling were also found to be
	very significant. The difference between the maximum and minimum
	values was as large as 1000 and 300 cm$^{-1}$ for the {IDA} and {TDC}
	methods, respectively. To account for these effects, the properties
	of the excited states were averaged over a large number of conformations
	obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations
	using the {TDC} method indicate that the absorption of the {UV} light
	creates exciton states carrying the majority of the oscillator strength
	that are delocalized over at least six {DNA} bases. Upon relaxation,
	the excitation states localize over at least four contiguous bases.},

	theoretical description of ultra-short time delays and to relate
	these to the phase of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and
	to the asymptotic phaseshifts of photoelectron wave packets. Special
	emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments, where attosecond XUV
	pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at well-defined times,
	followed by a probing process in real time by a phase-locked, infrared
	laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a 'clock' to
	monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not correspond
	directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization. Instead,
	a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement
	induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics.
	This artefact is traced back to a phaseshift of the above-threshold
	ionization transition matrix element, which we call the continuum--continuum
	phase . It arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between
	Coulomb continuum states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced
	effects can be separated from the single-photon ionization process,
	using analytical expressions of universal character, so that eventually
	the attosecond time delays in photoionization can be accessed.},

	of Z selectivity of the metathesis homodimerization of terminal olefins
	catalyzed by chelated ruthenium complexes. The chosen system is,
	without any simplification, the experimentally performed homocoupling
	reaction of 3-phenyl-1-propene with 1cat, a pivalate and N-heterocyclic
	carbene ({NHC)} chelated Ru precatalyst. The six-coordinate 1cat
	converts to a trigonal-bipyramidal intermediate (3) through initial
	dissociation and isomerization. The metathesis reaction of complex
	3 with 3-phenyl-1-propene occurs in a side-bound mechanism and generates
	the trigonal-bipyramidal Ru?benzylidene complex 6. Complex 6 is the
	active catalyst for the subsequent side-bound metathesis with 3-phenyl-1-propene,
	which forms metallacyclobutanes that lead to the (Z)- and (E)-olefin
	homodimers. The transition states of cycloreversion leading to the
	(Z)- and (E)-olefins differ in energy by 2.2 kcal/mol, which gives
	rise to a calculated Z selectivity that agrees with experimental
	results. The Z selectivity stems from reduced steric repulsion in
	the transition state. The regeneration of complex 6 occurs along
	with the formation of the gaseous byproduct ethylene, whose evolution
	drives the overall reaction. As our results indicate, the chelating
	ligands are crucial for this new class of Ru catalysts to achieve
	Z-selective olefin metathesis, because they direct olefin attack,
	differentiate energies of the transition states and intermediates,
	and support the complexes in certain coordination geometries.},

	(at 800 and 400 nm) as a function of internuclear distance R show
	strong evidence of enhanced ionization, in both single and double
	ionization, as well as enhanced excitation, in single and double
	excitation, as the internuclear distance R increases from the equilibrium
	value Re. The enhancement of all these molecular processes exhibits
	a maximum at a critical distance Rc, which can be predicted from

	to the importance of initial-state correlation and cross-section
	effects for a consistent reproduction of satellite bands recorded
	under x-ray photoionization. By extrapolating the results obtained
	to larger unsaturated hydrocarbons, it is clear that the signal recorded

	{Car?Parrinello} molecular dynamics ({MD)} with a multiconfigurational
	perturbation theory treatment of the electronic structure. The {MD}
	simulations were performed for four different tautomeric forms of
	cytosine in a unit cell with 60 water molecules. The relative energies
	and transition dipole moments of a large number of excited states
	have been calculated on a representative sample of conformations
	along the {MD} trajectories. In this way, the broad experimental
	peaks can be decomposed, and the effect of the distortions on the
	nature of the excited states can be assessed. The loss of planarity
	of the molecule is significant, and hence, the excited states can
	no longer be defined as pure $n\pi^*$ or $\pi\pi^*$ excitations.
	We propose an analysis to assign the different transitions according
	to the main contribution. The keto {N1H} form turns out to be the
	most stable one, and the calculated spectra of this tautomer show
	good agreement with experimental measurements. The mixed $n\pi^*$/$\pi\pi^*$
	character of some states leads to a significant increase of intensity
	in spectral regions dominated by the dark $n\pi^*$ transitions considering
	a planar structure.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations
	have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently,
	Alml\"of, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural
	orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations {(ANOs)} provide
	an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report
	here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing
	that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and
	efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the
	functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although
	the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can
	be taken from atomic {Hartree--Fock} calculations if the appropriate
	primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules
	indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation
	effects as well as the {ANO} sets of Alml\"of and Taylor. Guided
	by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic
	and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row
	atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen
	atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings
	due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups.
	This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e.,
	sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all
	functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given
	for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined
	in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation
	energy obtained with the corresponding {ANO} sets, even though the
	latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive
	polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%--97\%
	of the total {(HF+1+2)} correlation energy for the atoms neon through
	boron.},

  abstract = {The matrix elements of the spin--orbit operator between the zero-order
	(spin-free) (n, $\pi$*) states of nitrogen heterocyclics are examined.
	It is found that generally, to the first order, there is no spin--orbit
	coupling between singlet and triplet states of the same configuration.
	The coupling between states of different configurations due to differences
	in the occupancy of the $\pi$* orbitals, but having the same nonbonding
	orbital, is found to have matrix elements similar to those resulting
	from the coupling between ($\pi$, $\pi$*) states, which {McClure}
	has shown to be unimportant. For the diazines (or polyazines), the
	coupling between different configurations due to a different occupancy
	of the nonbonding orbitals is found to have matrix elements which
	cancel one another. The general conclusion is thus reached that spin--orbit
	(s.o.) coupling between singlet and triplet (n, $\pi$*) states is
	unimportant to the first order. Using the observed polarization and
	lifetime data, it is estimated that the ratiohas an upper value of
	10--3. These results as well as vibrational overlap considerations
	suggest that the enhancement of the efficiency of the intersystem
	crossing in nitrogen heterocyclics with the lowest singlet state
	of the (n, $\pi$*) type might be due to an S(n, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T($\pi$},
	$\pi$*) rather than an S(n, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T(n}, $\pi$*) radiationless
	process. An alternative explanation to the one previously given for
	the observation of fluorescence of 9, 10-diazaphenanthrene and s-tetrazine
	is thus suggested. In these molecules, the strong interaction between
	the (n, $\pi$*) singlet levels might cause the lowest S(n, $\pi$*)
	excited level to have a lower energy value than the ($\pi$, $\pi$*)
	triplet level. This would therefore lead to a retardation of the
	intersystem crossing process and allow the fluorescence to be observed.
	The characteristics of the observed weak phosphorescence of 9,10-diazaphenanthrene
	give spectroscopic support for this {proposal.For} nitrogen heterocyclic
	molecules with the lowest singlet and lowest triplet states of the
	($\pi$, $\pi$*) types, an examination of the quinoline total emission
	in comparison with that of the parent hydrocarbon, nath-thalene,
	suggests an increase in the efficiency of the intersystem crossing
	process in quinoline. This is suggested to be due to the efficient
	S1($\pi$, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T2(n}, {$\pi$*)$\rightarrow$T1($\pi$},
	$\pi$*) radiationless process. A probable enhancement of the internal
	conversion processes in these molecules is suggested to be due to
	an increase in the density of states and the efficiency of the S($\pi$,
	{$\pi$*)$\leftrightarrow$S(n}, $\pi$*) radiationless process due
	to a large vibrational overlap integral.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a unified treatment of non-radiative decay
	processes in large molecules which involve either electronic relaxation
	between two electronic states or unimolecular rearrangement reactions
	in excited electronic states. The present treatment is analogous
	to the formalism previously applied for the line shape problem in
	nuclear recoil and in the optical spectra of solids. We were able
	to derive theoretical expressions for the non-radiative decay probability
	so that an arbitrary number of different molecular vibrations can
	be incorporated in the vibrational overlap factors. The general expressions
	obtained herein can be reduced to analytical form for two limiting
	cases, which we call the strong coupling case (which corresponds
	to a substantial horizontal displacement of the potential energy
	surfaces of the two electronic states) and the weak coupling limit
	(whereupon the relative horizontal displacement of the two potential
	energy surfaces is small). Quantitative criteria for the applicability
	of these two coupling limits are provided. In the strong coupling
	limit the transition probability is determined by a gaussian function
	of the energy parameter {(?E} - {EM} ), where {?E} is the energy
	gap between the origins of the two electronic states and {2EM} is
	the Stokes shift. This limit exhibits a generalized Arrhenius type
	temperature behaviour whereupon the transition probability depends
	exponentially on the energy barrier for the intersection of the two
	potential surfaces. At low temperatures the transition probability
	is determined by the mean vibrational frequency and is thus expected
	to reveal only a moderately weak deuterium isotope effect. The weak
	coupling limit reveals an exponential (or rather superexponential)
	dependence of the transition probability on the energy gap {?E.}
	In this limit the transition probability is dominated by the highest
	vibrational frequency (e.g. the {C-H} or {C-D} vibrations) and thus
	will reveal a marked isotope effect. When semi-empirical estimates
	of the pre-exponential factors are provided, the approximate theoretical
	expression for the weak coupling limit is found to be consistent
	with the available experimental data on electronic relaxation in
	large organic molecules.},

  abstract = {In the past few years thionucleobases have been extensively used as
	intrinsic photolabels to probe the structure in solution of folded
	\{RNA\} molecules and to identify contacts within nucleic acids and/or
	between nucleic acids and proteins, in complex nucleoprotein assemblies.
	These thio residues such as 4-thiouracil found in E. coli tRNA and
	its non-natural congeners 4-thiothymine, 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine
	absorb light at wavelengths longer than 320 nm and, thus, can be
	selectively photoactivated. Synthetic or enzymatic procedures have
	been established, allowing the random or site-specific incorporation
	of thionucleotide(s) within a \{RNA\} (DNA) chain which, in most
	cases, retains unaltered structural and biological properties. Owing
	to the high photoreactivity of their triplet state (intersystem yield
	close to unity). 4-thiouracil and 4-thiothymine derivatives exhibit
	a high photocrosslinking ability towards pyrimidines (particularly
	thymine) but also purines. From the nature of the photoproducts obtained
	in base or nucleotide mixtures and in dinucleotides, the main photochemical
	pathway was identified as a (2 + 2) photoaddition of the excited
	C-S bond onto the 5, 6 double bond of pyrimidines yielding thietane
	intermediates whose structure could be characterized. Depending on
	the mutual orientation of these bonds in the thietanes, their subsequent
	dark rearrangement yielded, respectively, either the 5-4 or 6-4 bipyrimidine
	photoadduct. A similar mechanism appears to be involved in the formation
	of the unique photoadduct formed between 4-thiothymidine and adenosine.
	The higher reactivity of thymine derived acceptors can be explained
	by an additional pathway which involves hydrogen abstraction from
	the thymine methyl group, followed by radical recombination, leading
	to methylne linked bipyrimidines. The high photocrosslinking potential
	of thionucleosides inserted in nucleic acid chains has been used
	to probe RNA-RNA contacts within the ribosome permitting, in particular,
	the elucidation of the path of mRNA throughout the small ribosomal
	subunit. Functional interactions between the mRNA spliced sites and
	U \{RNAs\} could be detected within the spliceosome. Analysis of
	the photocrosslinks obtained within small endonucleolytic ribozymes
	in solution led to a tertiary folded pseudo-knot structure for the
	\{HDV\} ribozyme and allowed the construction of a Y form of a hammerhead
	ribozyme, which revealed to be in close agreement with the structure
	observed in crystals. Thionucleosides incorporated in nucleic acids
	crosslink efficiently aminoacid residues of proteins in contact with
	them. Despite the fact that little is known about the nature of the
	photoadducts formed, this approach has been extensively used to identify
	protein components interacting at a defined nucleic acid site and
	applied to various systems (replisome, spliceosome, transcription
	complexes and ribosomes). },

  abstract = {The {UV} components of sunlight are believed to be a major cause of
	human skin cancer, and {DNA} is thought to be the principal molecular
	target. Alterations of the intensity and wavelength distribution
	of solar {UV} radiation reaching the surface of the earth, for example
	by depletion of stratospheric ozone, will change the effectiveness
	of solar radiation in damaging {DNA} in human skin. Evaluation of
	the magnitude of such effects requires knowledge of the altered sunlight
	spectrum and of the action spectrum for damaging {DNA} in human skin.
	We have determined an action spectrum for the frequency of pyrimidine
	dimer formation induced in the {DNA} of human skin per unit dose
	of {UV} incident on the skin surface. The peak of this action spectrum
	is near 300 nm and decreases rapidly at both longer and shorter wavelengths.
	The decrease in our action spectrum for wavelengths less than 300
	nm is attributed to the absorption of the upper layers of the skin,
	an in situ effect that is inherently included in our measurements.
	Convolution of the dimer action spectrum with the solar spectra corresponding
	to a solar angle of 40 degrees under current levels of stratospheric
	ozone (0.32-cm O3 layer) and those for 50\% ozone depletion (0.16-cm
	O3 layer), indicate about a 2.5-fold increase in dimer formation.
	If the action spectrum for {DNA} damage that results in skin cancer
	resembles that for dimer induction in skin, our results, combined
	with epidemiological data, suggest that a 50\% decrease in stratospheric
	ozone would increase the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers among
	white males in Seattle, Washington, by 7.5- to 8-fold, to a higher
	incidence than is presently seen in the corresponding population
	of Albuquerque, New Mexico.},

  abstract = {We derive an expression to calculate approximate non-Condon, i.e.,
	coordinate-dependent, dipole couplings, for transitions from excited
	neutral to ionic states with zero electron kinetic energy {(ZEKE).}
	Our expression can be considered beyond Koopmans' picture since it
	is obtained for cases in which the initial neutral state is described
	multiconfigurationally - as excited states usually are - and the
	final ionic state is well represented by a single Slater determinant
	with non-frozen orbitals. It is composed of three terms: (i) the
	configuration interaction coefficients corresponding to determinants
	of the neutral molecule which differ in only one spin orbital from
	the ionic determinant, (ii) determinants depending on the overlaps
	of non-frozen orbitals of the initial neutral molecule and of the
	final ion, occupied with $\alpha$ or $\beta$ electrons, and (iii)
	the single electron matrix element between the initial and final
	orbitals, the latter representing the photo-detached electron. Exemplarily,
	transition probabilities are estimated from {MR-CCI/CASSCF} ab initio
	calculations for the recently investigated {C.} Daniel, J. Full,

	effects of increasing the dimensionality of the system on the adiabatic
	requirements of the method and the role of intramolecular coupling
	among the vibrational modes. By using a model of two-dimensional
	displaced harmonic oscillators with or without rotation of the normal
	mode axis of the excited states {(Duschinsky} effect) we find that
	(1) it is possible to selectively transfer the vibrational population
	by adiabatic elongation of the bonds, (2) the adiabatic demands depend
	mainly on the energy barrier between the ground and excited electronic
	configurations, and not on the dimension of the system, (3) in the
	presence of intramolecular couplings the selective transfer can be
	achieved but at the cost of increasing the duration and/or the intensity
	of the pulses, which are needed to overcome small avoided crossings,
	and (4) the problem of selectivity becomes more important as the
	vibrational energy of the initial wave function increases.},

	for the population of the triplet manifold in {DNA} nucleobases by
	determining, at the multiconfigurational {CASSCF/CASPT2} level, the
	singlet?triplet states crossing regions and the main decay paths
	for their lowest singlet and triplet states after near-{UV} irradiation.
	The studied singlet?triplet interacting regions are accessible along
	the minimum energy path of the initially populated singlet bright
	1$\pi\pi^*$ state. In particular, all five natural {DNA/RNA} nucleobases
	have, at the end of the main minimum energy path and near a conical
	intersection of the ground and 1$\pi\pi^*$ states, a low-energy,
	easily accessible, singlet?triplet crossing region directly connecting
	the lowest singlet and triplet $\pi\pi^*$ excited states. Adenine,
	thymine, and uracil display additional higher-energy crossing regions
	related to the presence of low-lying singlet and a triplet $n\pi^*$
	state. These funnels are absent in guanine and cytosine, which have
	the bright 1$\pi\pi^*$ state lower in energy and less accessible
	$n\pi^*$ states. Knowledge of the location and accessibility of these
	regions, in which the singlet?triplet interaction is related to large
	spin?orbit coupling elements, may help to understand experimental
	evidence such as the wavelength dependence measured for the triplet
	formation quantum yield in nucleobases and the prevalence of adenine
	and thymine components in the phosphorescence spectra of {DNA.}},

  abstract = {The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and
	subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating
	the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the
	outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated
	by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion
	occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10$^{-15}$
	s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized
	in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report
	an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence
	electrons in atomic krypton ions1. We generate the ions with a controlled
	few-cycle laser field2 and then probe them through the spectrally
	resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse3,
	which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion
	of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able
	to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion
	and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble.
	Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system,
	attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable
	to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron
	motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties
	and processes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we set up a method called overlap decoherence correction
	{(ODC)} to take into account the quantum decoherence effect in a
	surface hopping framework. While keeping the standard surface hopping
	approach based on independent trajectories, our method allows to
	account for quantum decoherence by evaluating the overlap between
	frozen Gaussian wavepackets, the time evolution of which is obtained
	in an approximate way. The {ODC} scheme mainly depends on the parameter
	?, which is the Gaussian width of the wavepackets. The performance
	of the {ODC} method is tested versus full quantum calculations on
	three model systems, and by comparison with full multiple spawning
	{(FMS)} results for the {S(1){\textrightarrow}S(0)} decay in the
	azobenzene molecule.},

	have been measured using femtosecond \{UV\} fluorescence upconversion
	in various protic and aprotic polar solvents. The fastest decays
	are observed in acetonitrile and the slowest in aqueous solution
	while those observed in alcohols are intermediate. No direct correlation
	with macroscopic solvent parameters such as polarity or viscosity
	is found, but hydrogen bonding is one key factor affecting the fluorescence
	decay. It is proposed that the solvent modulates the relative energy
	of two close-lying electronically excited states, the bright ???
	and the dark n?? states. This relative energy gap controls the non-radiative
	relaxation of the ??? state through a conical intersection close
	to the Franck?Condon region competing with the ultrafast internal
	conversion to the ground state. In addition, an inverse isotope effect
	is observed in \{D2O\} where the decays are faster than in H2O. },

	relaxation of excited electronic states created by absorption of
	267-nm light in all of the naturally occurring pyrimidine {DNA} and
	{RNA} bases in aqueous solution. The results reveal a surprising
	bifurcation of the initial excited-state population in {\textless}1
	ps to two nonradiative decay channels within the manifold of singlet
	states. The first is the subpicosecond internal conversion channel
	first characterized in 2000. The second channel involves passage
	through a dark intermediate state assigned to a lowest-energy 1$n\pi^*$
	state. Approximately 10--50\% of all photoexcited pyrimidine bases
	decay via the 1$n\pi^*$ state, which has a lifetime of 10--150 ps.
	Three- to 6-fold-longer lifetimes are seen for pyrimidine nucleotides
	and nucleosides than for the corresponding free bases, revealing
	an unprecedented effect of ribosyl substitution on electronic energy
	relaxation. A small fraction of the 1$n\pi^*$ population is proposed
	to undergo intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state in competition
	with vibrational cooling, explaining the higher triplet yields observed
	for pyrimidine versus purine bases at room temperature. Some simple
	correlations exist between yields of the 1$n\pi^*$ state and yields
	of some pyrimidine photoproducts, but more work is needed before
	the photochemical consequences of this state can be definitively
	determined. These findings lead to a dramatically different picture
	of electronic energy relaxation in single pyrimidine bases with important
	ramifications for understanding {DNA} photostability.},

	the lowest-energy bright state, a 1$\pi\pi^*$ state, which has a
	lifetime of 120?270 fs, depending on the solvent. In all solvents,
	this initial bright state population bifurcates with ?60\% undergoing
	subpicosecond nonradiative decay to the electronic ground state and
	the remaining population branching to a singlet dark state. The latter
	absorbs between 340 and 450 nm. The latter state is assigned to the
	lowest-energy 1$n\pi^*$ state. It decays to the electronic ground
	state with a lifetime that varies from 26 ps in water to at least
	several nanoseconds in aprotic solvents. The results suggest that
	the two nonradiative decay pathways identified for photoexcited uracil
	in recent quantum chemical calculations (Matsika, S. J. Phys. Chem.
	A. 2004, 108, 7584) are simultaneously operative in a wide variety
	of solvent environments. The lowest-energy triplet state was also
	detected by transient absorption. The triplet population appears
	in a few picoseconds and is not formed from the thermalized 1$n\pi^*$
	state. It is suggested that high spin?orbit coupling is found only

  abstract = {The excited state dynamics of the {Na2F} cluster initiated by a femtosecond
	laser pulse is studied by quantum wave packet propagation within
	a pump-probe setup. The probe pulse is supposed to ionize the system
	to yield a photoelectron spectrum that depends on the time delay
	between the pump- and probe pulse. It is shown that the time dependence
	of the photoelectron spectrum is an extremely sensitive tool to study
	intramolecular motion of the cluster like the energy flow between
	different internal modes. The potential energy surfaces involved
	in the photoinduced process are calculated from a pseudopotential
	model with repulsive and Coulomb potentials for the ions and a quantum
	description of the excess electron via electron-Na+ and electron-F--
	pseudopotentials, polarization of the ionic cores as well as electron-ion
	correlation being added perturbatively. The nuclear motion upon laser
	excitation is described by full-dimensional quantum wave packet propagation
	using realistic laser pulse parameters. We find that the pump-probe
	signal is essentially dominated by the bending motion of the cluster
	with a periodicity of 180 fs. In addition, we also report detailed
	structures in the photoelectron spectrum which can be attributed
	to the excitation of the stretching mode. The possibility of experimental
	observation of the predicted dynamical behavior is discussed. \copyright\

  abstract = {During the past decade the understanding of photo-induced ultrafast
	dynamics in molecular systems has improved at an unforeseen speed
	and a wealth of detailed insight into the fundamental processes has
	been obtained. This review summarizes our present knowledge on ultrafast
	dynamics in isolated molecules and molecular clusters evolving after
	excitation with femtosecond pulses as studied by pump?probe analysis
	in real time. Experimental tools and methods as well as theoretical
	models are described which have been developed to glean information
	on primary, ultrafast processes in photophysics, photochemistry and
	photobiology. The relevant processes are explained by way of example?from
	wave packet dynamics in systems with a few atoms all the way to internal
	conversion via conical intersections in bio-chromophores. A systematic
	overview on characteristic systems follows, starting with diatomic
	and including larger organic molecules as well as various types of
	molecular clusters, such as micro-solvated chromophore molecules.
	For conciseness the focus is on molecular systems which remain unperturbed
	by the laser pulses?apart from the excitation and detection processes
	as such. Thus, only some aspects of controlling and manipulating
	molecular reactions by shaped and/or very intense laser pulses are
	discussed briefly for particularly instructive examples, illustrating
	the perspectives of this prospering field. The material presented
	in this review comprises some prototypical examples from earlier
	pioneering work but emphasizes studies from recent years and covers
	the most important and latest developments until January 2006.},

	Numerical applications of the present method include the interaction

	coordinate, the Rydberg- valence mixing between two 3$\Pi$u states
	in O2 and the interaction of four states of 3$\Pi$g symmetry in the

	been measured. The photoelectron angular distributions indicate the
	presence of nearly degenerate electronic states of the 1-pyrazolyl-d3
	radical. Equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled-cluster
	singles and doubles {(EOMIP-CCSD)} calculations have been performed
	to study the low-lying electronic states. The calculations strongly
	suggest that three electronic states, energetically close to each
	other, are accessed in the photodetachment process. Strong interactions
	of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller type in each pair of the three states are
	evident in the calculations for the radical at the anion geometry.
	Model diabatic potentials of the three states have been constructed
	around the anion geometry in terms of the anion reduced normal coordinates
	up to the second order. An analytic method to parametrize the quadratic
	vibronic coupling {(QVC)} model potentials has been introduced. Parameters
	of the {QVC} model potentials have been determined from the {EOMIP-CCSD}
	and {CCSD(T)} calculations. Simulations of the 1-pyrazolide-d3 spectrum
	have been performed with the model Hamiltonian, treating all vibronic
	interactions amongst the three states simultaneously. The simulation
	reproduces the fine structure of the observed spectrum very well,
	revealing complicated nonadiabatic effects in the low-lying states
	of the radical. The ground state of the 1-pyrazolyl-d3 radical is
	and the electron affinity is 2.935$\pm$0.006 {eV} The first excited
	state is with a term energy of 32$\pm$1 {meV}. While the high-symmetry
	{(C2v)} stationary points of the X2A2 and A2B1 states are minima,
	that of the B2B2 state is a saddle point as a result of the pseudo-Jahn-Teller
	interactions with the other two states. The topology of the adiabatic
	potential energy surfaces is discussed.},

	{DFT} calculations, using the last generation {M052X} functional,

	continuum model. Especially when at least one of the sugars adopts
	C3-endo puckering, a barrierless path on the bright $\pi\pi^*$ excitons
	leads to the {S1/S0} crossing region corresponding to the formation
	of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. Charge transfer excited states involving
	the transfer of an electron from the 5? Thy toward the 3? Thy are
	involved in the formation of the oxetane intermediate in the path
	leading to 6-4 pyrimidine pyrimidinone adducts. A non-negligible

	122, 9348. Pecourt, J.-M. L.; Peon, J.; Kohler, B. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
	2001, 123, 10370), show that the excited states produced by 263 nm
	light in these nucleosides decay in the subpicosecond range (290?720
	fs). Ultrafast radiationless decay to the ground state greatly reduces
	the probability of photochemical damage. In this work we present
	a theoretical study of isolated cytosine, the chromophore of cytidine.
	The experimental lifetime of 720 fs indicates that there must be
	an ultrafast decay channel for this species. We have documented the
	possible decay channels and approximate energetics, using a valence-bond
	derived analysis to rationalize the structural details of the paths.
	The mechanism favored by our calculations and the experimental data
	involves (1) a two-mode decay coordinate composed of initial bond
	length inversion followed by internal vibrational energy redistribution
	({IVR)} to populate a carbon pyramidalization mode, (2) a state switch
	between the $\pi\pi^*$ and $n_O\pi^*$ (excitation from oxygen lone
	pair) excited states, and (3) decay to the ground state through a
	conical intersention. A second decay path through the $n_N\pi^*$
	state (excitation from the nitrogen lone pair), with a higher barrier,
	involves out-of-plane bending of the amino substituent.},

	property due to extremely facile internal conversion, and therefore
	the lifetime should be largely independent of the medium at this

  abstract = {The photodissociation reaction of {SO2} via the {C 1B2} state, {SO2(C
	1B2)} $\rightarrow$ {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} was investigated by
	experimental and theoretical approaches cooperatively to clarify
	its dissociation mechanism. We measured the laser induced fluorescence
	{(LIF)} spectrum of the {C-X} band in the short {UV} wavelength region
	(210-200 nm) under jet-cooled conditions. The fluorescence quantum
	yields and the dissociation rates of individual vibronic levels were
	determined in the 220-200-nm region using (i) the {LIF} spectrum
	measured in the present study, (ii) that measured previously by Yamanouchi
	et al. {(J.} Mol. Struct. 352/353 (1995) 541) in the longer wavelength
	region above 210 nm, and (iii) the high-resolution absorption spectrum
	measured by Freeman et al. {(Planet.} Space. Sci. 32 (1984) 1125).
	The dissociation rates were also derived in the 210-200-nm region
	from the broadening of the rotational lines of the {C-X} vibronic
	transitions. It was found that the dissociation rates determined
	through two different procedures were consistent with each other,
	and that the rate increases almost exponentially as an excess energy
	above the dissociation threshold increases though there is a certain
	fluctuation of the dissociation rates reflecting a mode specificity.
	We also performed theoretical ab initio calculations to derive potential
	energy surfaces {(PESs)} of the electronic ground states and low-lying
	electronically excited states of {SO2} within the {MCSCF} and {MRCI}
	levels. The theoretical calculations showed that (i) the {PES} of
	the {21A'} state (the {C1B2} state in C2v symmetry), correlating
	with the {SO(1$\Delta$)} + {O(1D)} asymptote, crosses with the repulsive
	singlet {(31A')} state, correlating with the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)}
	asymptote, to form a pseudo-seam, (ii) the crossing pseudo-seam of
	these two {PESs} is located near the equilibrium bent angles for
	the X and C states along the energy contour of ~9700 cm-1 measured
	from the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} dissociation limit, and (iii)
	the crossing seam between the {21A'} {(C1B2)} and repulsive {23A'}
	states is located in a lower energy region than the singlet seam;
	at ~6700 cm-1 measured from the {SO(3$\Sigma$-)} + {O(3P)} dissociation
	limit. On the basis of the above experimental and theoretical results
	together with the previous experimental evidence, we propose that
	(i) the photodissociation reaction via the C state proceeds mainly
	through the vibronic mixing between the C state vibronic levels with
	the quasi-bound dissociation continuum of the electronic ground {X1A1}
	state, and (ii) the additional dissociation channels may be open
	through the crossing seam with the repulsive singlet {(31A')} state
	and that with the repulsive triplet {(23A')} state in their narrow
	crossing energy regions.},

	The most effective procedure involved molecular dynamics, and a general

	catalytic geometries were observed for a number of designs. Penetration
	of water into the catalytic site and insufficient residue-packing
	around the active site are the main factors that can cause enzyme
	designs to be inactive. Where in the past, computational evaluations
	of designed enzymes were too time-extensive for practical considerations,
	it has now become feasible to rank and refine candidates computationally
	prior to and in conjunction with experimentation, thus markedly increasing
	the efficiency of the enzyme design process.},

  abstract = {Three-state conical intersections have been located and characterized
	for cytosine and its analog 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone using multireference
	configuration-interaction ab initio methods. The potential energy
	surfaces for each base contain three different three-state intersections:
	two different S0-S1-S2 intersections ({gs/$\pi\pi^*$/$n_N\pi^*$}
	and {gs/$\pi\pi^*$/$n_O\pi^*$)} and an S1-S2-S3 intersection ({$\pi\pi^*$/$n_N\pi^*$/$n_O\pi^*$).}
	Two-state seam paths from these intersections are shown to be connected
	to previously reported two-state conical intersections. Nonadiabatic
	coupling terms have been calculated, and the effects of the proximal
	third state on these quantities are detailed. In particular, it is
	shown that when one of these loops incorporates more than one seam
	point, there is a profound and predictable effect on the phase of
	the nonadiabatic coupling terms, and as such provides a diagnostic
	for the presence and location of additional seams. In addition, it
	is shown that each of the three three-state conical intersections
	located on cytosine and 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone is qualitatively
	similar between the two bases in terms of energies and character,
	implying that, like with the stationary points and two-state conical
	intersections previously reported for these two bases, there is an
	underlying pattern of energy surfaces for 2-pyrimidinone bases, in
	general, and this pattern also includes three-state conical intersections.},

  abstract = {The ultrafast radiationless decay mechanism of photoexcited cytosine
	has been theoretically supported by exploring the important potential
	energy surfaces using multireference configuration?interaction ab
	initio methods for the gas-phase keto-tautomer free base. At vertical
	excitation, the bright state is S1 ($\pi\pi^*$) at 5.14 {eV}, with
	S2 ({$n\pi^*$)} and S3 ({$n_O\pi^*$)} being dark states at 5.29 and
	5.93 {eV}, respectively. Minimum energy paths connect the {Franck?Condon}
	region to a shallow minimum on the $\pi\pi^*$ surface at 4.31 {eV.}
	Two different energetically accessible conical intersections with
	the ground state surface are shown to be connected to this minimum.
	One pathway involves N3 distorting out of plane in a sofa conformation,
	and the other pathway involves a dihedral twist about the {C5?C6}
	bond. Each of these pathways from the minimum contains a low barrier
	of 0.14 {eV}, easily accessed by low vibronic levels. The path involving
	the N3 sofa distortion leads to a conical intersection with the ground
	state at 4.27 {eV.} The other pathway leads to an intersection with
	the ground state at 3.98 {eV}, lower than the minimum by about 0.3
	{eV.} Comparisons with our previously reported study of the fluorescent
	cytosine analogue 5-methyl-2-pyrimidinone ({5M2P)} reveal remarkably
	similar conformational distortions throughout the decay pathways
	of both bases. The different photophysical behavior between the two
	molecules is attributed to energetic differences. Vertical excitation
	in cytosine occurs at a much higher energy initially, creating more
	vibrational energy than {5M2P} in the {Franck?Condon} region, and
	the minimum S1 energy for {5M2P} is too low to access an intersection
	with the ground state, causing population trapping and fluorescence.
	Calculations of vertical excitation energies of 5-amino-2-pyrimidinone
	and 2-pyrimidinone reveal that the higher excitation energy of cytosine
	is likely due to the presence of the amino group at the 4-position.},

	molecular ionization. We compare predictions based on Dyson orbital
	norms and quasistatic semiclassical tunneling theories (Keldysh and
	molecular orbital Ammosov-Delone-Krainov) with more detailed calculations
	of strong-field ionization which take into account (i) the Coulomb
	interaction between the outgoing continuum electron wave packet and
	the remaining bound electrons and (ii) electron-core interactions
	that cause distortions of the electronic continuum states during
	the ionization event. Our results highlight the prominence of electronic
	rearrangement effects in strong-field ionization with intense ultrafast
	laser pulses, where the outgoing continuum electron can cause electronic
	transitions in the parent ion. Calculations and measurements for
	excited uracil molecules reveal the breakdown of Keldysh-weighted
	Dyson norm predictions for ionization to different states of the
	molecular cation in the strong-field regime.},

	and couplings. Single-reference methods, {CIS}, {CIS(2)}, {EOM-CCSD},
	{TDDFT}, and the multireference method {CASSCF}, have been used,
	and their performance has been compared. It is found that the excited-state
	energies are very sensitive to the applied method but the couplings
	are not as sensitive. Inclusion of diffuse functions in the basis
	set also affects the excitation energies significantly but not the
	couplings. {TDDFT} is inadequate in describing the states and their
	coupling, while {CIS(2)} gives results very similar to {EOM-CCSD.}
	Excited states of cytosine and adenine $\pi$-stacked dimers were
	also obtained and compared with those of thymine dimers to gain a
	more general picture of excited states in $\pi$-stacked {DNA} base
	dimers. The coupling is very sensitive to the relative position and
	orientation of the bases, indicating great variation in the degree
	of delocalization of the excited states between stacked bases in

	attosecond pulses using a fibre laser-pumped optical parametric amplifier

	of the potential energy surfaces have been carried out at the multireference

	conical intersection which occurs between the potential energy surfaces,

	states. Wave-packet propagation on the coupled surfaces was performed
	and allowed to reproduce with good accuracy the complex absorption
	band observed experimentally in the 29.000--42.000 cm$^{-1}$ range.

	at the semiempirical {OM2/MRCI} level of theory. The relevant potential
	energy surfaces were characterized by performing geometry optimizations
	of the energy minima of the lowest electronic states and of the most
	important conical intersections and by computing excitation energies
	at each configuration. Surface-hopping molecular dynamics simulations
	were performed to describe the nonadiabatic dynamics after excitation
	into the optically active state. In each of the molecules, the two
	lowest excited singlet states are involved in the dynamics, and there
	are competing relaxation paths. The dynamics is dominated by a two-step
	relaxation mechanism in uracil and thymine, while the direct decay
	to the ground state is most important in cytosine. For all three
	molecules, the simulations yield ultrafast {S2?S1} deexcitation within
	50 fs and internal conversion to the ground state in less than 1
	ps, consistent with recent experimental results from time-resolved
	photoelectron spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {It was recently shown that thymine dimers in the all-thymine oligonucleotide
	({dT)18} are fully formed in \&lt;1 ps after ultraviolet excitation.
	The speed and low quantum yield of this reaction suggest that only
	a small fraction of the conformers of this structurally disordered
	oligonucleotide are in a position to react at the instant of photon
	absorption. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that conventional
	molecular dynamics simulations can be used to predict the yield of
	cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in {DNA.} Conformations obtained from
	simulations of thymidylyl-(3'-5')-thymidine in various cosolvents
	were classified as dimerizable or nondimerizable depending on the
	distance between the C5-C6 double bonds of the adjacent thymine bases
	and the torsion angle between them. The quantum yield of cyclobutane
	pyrimidine dimer formation was calculated as the number of dimerizable
	conformations divided by the total number of conformations. The experimental
	quantum yields measured in the different solvents were satisfactorily
	reproduced using physically reasonable values for the two parameters.
	The mean dimerizable structure computed by averaging all of the dimerizable
	cis-syn conformations is structurally similar to the actual cis-syn
	dimer. Compared to the canonical B-form {TT} step, the most important
	structural property of a dimerizable conformation is its reduced
	helical twist angle of 22$^\circ$.},

	high harmonic generation has uncovered extremely rapid electronic
	dynamics in atoms and diatomics. We showed that high harmonic generation
	can reveal coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in polyatomic
	molecules. By exciting large amplitude vibrations in dinitrogen tetraoxide,
	we showed that tunnel ionization accesses the ground state of the
	ion at the outer turning point of the vibration but populates the
	first excited state at the inner turning point. This state-switching
	mechanism is manifested as bursts of high harmonic light that is
	emitted mostly at the outer turning point. Theoretical calculations
	attribute the large modulation to suppressed emission from the first
	excited state of the ion. More broadly, these results show that high
	harmonic generation and strong-field ionization in polyatomic molecules
	undergoing bonding or configurational changes involve the participation
	of multiple molecular orbitals.},

  abstract = {{3D} wave-packet dynamical calculations have been performed for the
	coupled {1B1--1A2} electronics states of {SO2}, based on large-scale
	{CASSCF} calculations of Rosmus and co-workers. The full anharmonic
	(diabatic) potential energy surfaces have been used while the vibronic
	coupling terms were taken to be a linear function of the asymmetric
	stretch coordinate. Due to dipole selection rules, the initial wave
	packet is created on the lower surface of the interacting states
	but above the minimum energy of their conical intersection. The calculations

	in conjunction with a trajectory surface-hopping method is used to
	study intersystem crossing effects in the S + H2 reaction. These
	calculations are based on high-quality potential surfaces that we
	have determined for the two lowest triplet states of {SH2} and globally
	determined spin-orbit coupling matrix elements that are obtained
	from {CASSCF} calculations. A previously determined surface for the
	lowest singlet state {(Ho,} {T.-S.;} Hollebeek, T.; Rabitz, H.; Chao,
	S. D.; Skodje, R. T.; Zyubin, A. S.; Mebel, A. M. J. Chem. Phys.
	2002, 116, 4124) is also used. We find that in contrast to the {O(3P)}
	+ H2 reaction, which we studied previously at the same level, there
	is significant intersystem crossing in the {S(3P)} + H2 reaction.
	In particular, for the reaction starting from triplet S + H2 close
	to the threshold, the dominant mechanism involves intersystem crossing
	to the singlet state prior to encountering the triplet barrier, and
	as a result, the thermal rate constant at low temperatures is controlled
	by intersystem crossing. This behavior occurs in part because the
	spin-orbit coupling is about 3 times larger in S than in O, but another
	important factor is the location of the singlet/triplet crossing,
	which occurs on the reagent side of the triplet barrier in S + H2
	and on the product side in O + H2. We also find that trajectories
	that undergo a triplet-to-singlet transition have higher product
	rotational excitation than those that remain on the triplet surfaces.
	For the {S(1D)} + H2 reaction, we find significant electronic quenching
	due to intersystem crossing, leading to a factor of 2 or more reduction
	in the reactive cross section, and a much flatter dependence of the
	cross section on collision energy for energies above 2.5 kcal/mol.
	This result agrees with recent molecular beam measurements.},

	The inertial prediction of equal probability formation of ground-state

	of the ground cis isomer is replaced by the {GLE} prediction of a
	preferential higher proportion of ground-state trans isomer, that

	transitions to the S0 ground state are centered around the {CI} seam
	(which is due to the solvent coordinate{\textquoteright}s role as

	the decay occurs, on average, away from the {CI} seam in regions
	with a finite free-energy gap between the excited and ground states,

	model is proposed on the basis of time-resolved measurements (fluorescence
	decays{,} fluorescence anisotropy decays and fluorescence spectra{,}

	spectra. According to this qualitative model{,} excitation at 267
	nm populates excited states that are delocalized over a few bases
	(excitons). Ultrafast internal conversion directs the excited state
	population to the lower part of the exciton band giving rise to fluorescence.
	Questions needing further investigations{,} both theoretical and

	a perfectly symmetric ground state. What does it take to break this

	of a linearly polarized photon, which itself has inversion symmetry.
	In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation
	of the remaining H-2(+) fragment shows no symmetry with respect to
	the ionic H+ and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry
	results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric
	H-2(+) states that is caused by autoionization. The mechanisms behind
	this symmetry breaking are general for all molecules.},

	of {TT} steps in several {DNA} structures, including hairpins where
	the context dependence of the photodimerization yield is determined,
	and it develops a theoretical model that correctly describes the
	trends in dimerization yield with {DNA} structure. The {DNA} conjugates
	considered include {dT20}, {dA20dT20}, and three alkane-linked hairpins
	that contain a single {TT} step. The theoretical modeling of the
	[2+2] process is based on {CASSCF} electronic structure calculations
	for ethylene + ethylene, which show that photoexcitation of low-lying
	excited states leads to potential surfaces that correlate without
	significant barriers to a conical intersection with the ground state
	surface at geometries close to the dimer structure. The primary constraint
	on dimerization is the distance d between the two double bonds, and
	it is found that d {\textless} 3.52 \AA\ leads to quantum yield trends
	that match the observed trends within a factor of 3. Constraints
	on the dihedral angle between the two double bonds are not as important,
	and although it is possible to generate better dimerization yield
	predictions for some structures by including these constraints, the
	best overall picture is obtained with no constraint. For 6-4 dimerization,
	a distance g {\textless} 2.87 \AA\ and no constraint on dihedral
	angle provide an accurate description of the yield.},

	where v'1, v'2, v'3, are the quantum numbers of the symmetrical valence,
	the deformation and the antisymmetrical vibrations respectively.
	The three fundamental frequencies for infinitesimal vibrations in
	the upper electronic state are v'1=794, v'2=345 and v'3=833 cm-1.
	In addition, twelve bands have been identified that correspond to
	transitions from excited vibrational levels in the normal state.
	The relatively long v'1 and v'2 progressions indicate that both the
	bond distance and the angle have changed considerably in the transition
	to the excited electronic state. The vibrationless transition at
	29622 cm-1 is weak, as one would have expected from considerations
	of the {Franck-Condon} principle. Substituting the three fundamental
	frequencies in the formula based on a valence force model, one obtains
	a value of 100$^\circ$ for the apex angle in the excited state, as
	compared with 120$^\circ$ in the normal state. The absence of any
	regularity in the rotational structure supports the resulting conclusion

	in vacuum {UV} are studied by using two-dimensional photoelectron
	spectroscopy with a monochromatized synchrotron radiation source.
	The principal focus is on the mechanisms of autoionization and neutral
	dissociation of superexcited states. Photoelectron spectra of {SO2}
	exhibit characteristic peaks at the electron kinetic energy below
	1.8 {eV} which are assigned as resulting from autoionizing transitions
	of excited atomic sulfur, S*, into the ground {S+(4S$^\circ$)} state.
	These S* atoms are in the singlet Rydberg states converging to {S+(2D$^\circ$).}
	The precursor molecular states, {SO2*}, are considered to be multiple-electron
	excited Rydberg states lying at the photon energy above ~22 {eV.}
	The onset of the photoelectron yield due to the atomic autoionization
	accords with that expected from the thermochemical threshold for
	the formation of S* through three-body dissociation {SO2*$\rightarrow$S*+O+O.}
	The two-dimensional photoelectron spectrum of {CS2} provides tangible
	evidence for the formation of a dipole-forbidden Rydberg state (6$\sigma$g)-1(3d$\sigma$g)11$\Sigma$g+
	at the photon energy of 14.88 {eV} which autoionizes into the v3=1
	vibrational state of the antisymmetric stretch $\nu$3 mode of {CS2+}
	{(X2$\Pi$g},$\Omega$, $\Omega$=1/2 and 3/2). This Rydberg state is
	expected to borrow substantial oscillator strength from the (6$\sigma$g)-1(5p$\sigma$u)11$\Sigma$u+
	state through vibronic coupling involving the $\nu$3 vibration.},

  abstract = {Solar {UV} radiation is the most important environmental factor involved
	in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. The well known genotoxic properties
	of {UVB} radiation (290-320 nm) mostly involve bipyrimidine {DNA}
	photoproducts. In contrast, the contribution of more-abundant {UVA}
	radiation (320-400 nm) that are not directly absorbed by {DNA} remains
	poorly understood in skin. Using a highly accurate and quantitative
	assay based on {HPLC} coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we determined
	the type and the yield of formation of {DNA} damage in whole human
	skin exposed to {UVB} or {UVA.} Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, a
	typical {UVB-induced} {DNA} damage, were found to be produced in
	significant yield also in whole human skin exposed to {UVA} through
	a mechanism different from that triggered by {UVB.} Moreover, the
	latter class of photoproducts is produced in a larger amount than
	8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, the most common oxidatively
	generated lesion, in human skin. Strikingly, the rate of removal
	of {UVA-generated} cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was lower than those
	produced by {UVB} irradiation of skin. Finally, we compared the formation
	yields of {DNA} damage in whole skin with those determined in primary
	cultures of keratinocytes isolated from the same donors. We thus
	showed that human skin efficiently protects against {UVB-induced}
	{DNA} lesions, whereas very weak protection is afforded against {UVA.}
	These observations emphasize the likely role played by the {UVA-induced}
	{DNA} damage in skin carcinogenesis and should have consequences
	for photoprotection strategies.},

	These are the non-adiabatic (either radially or rotationally induced)
	transitions and the decay (auto-ionization) mechanisms of `superexcited
	states'. The interdisciplinarity of the concept of non-adiabatic
	transition is emphasized, and the present status of the semiclassical
	theory is inclusively summarized together with some numerical applications.
	Particular emphasis is put on the non-adiabatic tunnelling process
	which is supposed to be an important key mechanism for state (or
	phase) change in various fields. Definitions of two kinds of superexcited
	state are given, and their peculiarities and richness in their participating
	dynamic processes are explained. The multichannel quantum defect
	theory is outlined and recommended as a powerful theoretical tool
	for dealing with the various dynamic processes such as photo-ionization,
	photodissociation, autoionization, dissociative recombination and
	associative ionization. Some numerical applications are also presented
	in order to promote the understanding of the mechanisms. The underlying
	philosophy throughout this paper is to try to clarify the basic mechanisms

	{(Spectroscopy} {ORiented} {CI}, {SORCI)} is proposed to calculate
	energy differences between several electronic states of possibly
	different multiplicity and which can be extended to fairly large
	molecules. It combines several well-known concepts in order to achieve
	efficiency, balance, generality, stability and accuracy: (a) the
	use of any kind of (preferably small) reference space and any kind
	of initial self-consistent field treatment, (b) the use of average
	approximate natural orbitals {(AANOs)} for the states of interest,
	(c) a variational treatment of the strongly interacting many electron
	states combined with second order multireference {M{\o}ller--Plesset}
	perturbation theory for the much larger weakly interacting remainder,
	(d) the concept of difference-dedicated {CI} developed and extensively
	used by Malrieu and co-workers that avoids contributions which are
	expected to cancel in energy differences, (e) the use of the resolution-of-the
	identity approximation to avoid exceedingly large integral files.
	The method is completely devoid of intruder state problems and makes
	extensive use of truncation techniques in order to achieve computational
	efficiency. Currently three cutoffs are introduced that control the
	size of the reference space, the size of the variational treatment
	and the size of the {AANO} basis. Test calculations show that the
	method is stable against variations of these parameters over a wide
	range. A study of prototypical molecules ranging in size between
	diatomics and free-base porphin indicates that the method yields
	accurate results even with moderate basis sets and {CI} dimensions
	that typically do not exceed ~ 105 configuration state functions.
	Transition energies are typically predicted within 0.1--0.3 {eV}

	active space self-consistent field {(CASSCF)} calculations is provided.
	These methods allow the correct zeroth order description of arbitrary
	electron states including singly and doubly excited ligand field
	or atomic multiplet states. This is followed by a cursory discussion
	of the treatment of dynamic correlation by using multireference {(MR)}
	many body perturbation theory in form of a second order correction
	to the {CASSCF} energy {(CASPT2).} {MR} based configuration interaction
	{(MRCI)} methods are also briefly touched and the spectroscopy oriented
	{CI} {(SORCI)} variant developed in this laboratory is described
	in some detail. The operators to describe the leading relativistic
	effects (scalar relativity and spin-orbit coupling {(SOC))} are described
	afterwards. The {CASSCF} and {SORCI} methods are first applied to
	the calculation of the multiplets of the free dipositive and tripositive
	first-row transition metal ions followed by a discussion of calculations
	of molecular d--d multiplet states in dipositive and tripositive
	hexaquo complexes of the first transition row. We then turn to the

	in some detail. The final part of the review provides an introduction
	into the theory of the resonance Raman effect, the possible quantum
	chemical calculation of resonance Raman intensities, the implementation
	of the method into the {ORCA} electronic structure program system

	Formally, Dyson orbitals represent the overlap between an initial
	N-electron wave function and the N--1 electron wave function of the
	corresponding ionized system. For the ground state ionization, Dyson
	orbitals are often similar to the corresponding Hartree-Fock molecular
	orbitals {(MOs);} however, for ionization from electronically excited
	states Dyson orbitals include contributions from several {MOs} and
	their shapes are more complex. The theory is applied to calculating
	the Dyson orbitals for ionization of formaldehyde from the ground
	and electronically excited states. Partial-wave analysis is employed
	to compute the probabilities to find the ejected electron in different
	angular momentum states using the freestanding and Coulomb wave representations
	of the ionized electron. Rydberg states are shown to yield higher
	angular momentum electrons, as compared to valence states of the
	same symmetry. Likewise, faster photoelectrons are most likely to
	have higher angular momentum.},

	The wavenumbers corresponding to \{C1\} and \{C2b\} tautomers were

  abstract = {Cyclobutane?pyrimidine dimer yields in {UV-irradiated} {DNA} are controlled
	by the equilibrium between forward and reverse photoreactions. Past
	studies have shown that dimer yields are suppressed at sites adjacent
	to a purine base, but the underlying causes are unclear. In order
	to investigate whether this suppression is the result of repair by
	electron transfer from a neighboring nucleobase, the yields and dynamics
	of the reverse reaction were studied using trinucleotides containing
	a cis?syn dimer (T{\textless}{\textgreater}T) flanked on the 5? or
	the 3? side by adenine or guanine. The probability of forming an
	excited state on T{\textless}{\textgreater}T or on the purine base
	was varied by tuning the irradiation wavelength between 240 and 280
	nm. Cleavage quantum yields decrease by an order of magnitude over
	this wavelength range and are less than 1\% at 280 nm, a wavelength
	that excites the purine base with more than 95\% probability. Conditional
	quantum yields of cleavage for the trinucleotides given excitation
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T are similar in magnitude to the quantum
	yield of cleavage of unmodified T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. These
	results indicate that within experimental uncertainty all photoreversal
	in these single-stranded substrates is the result of direct electronic
	excitation of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. Photolyase-like repair
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T due to electron transfer from an adjacent
	purine is negligible in these substrates. Instead, the observed variation
	in photoreversal quantum yields for adenine- versus guanine-flanked
	cis?syn dimer could be due to uncertainties in absorption cross sections
	or to a modest quenching effect by the purine on the excited state
	of T{\textless}{\textgreater}T. Pump?probe measurements reveal that
	the excited-state lifetimes of A or G in the dimer-containing trinucleotides
	are unperturbed by the neighboring dimer, indicating that electron
	transfer from purine base to T{\textless}{\textgreater}T is not competitive
	with rapid excited-state deactivation. Pump?probe measurements on
	unmodified T{\textless}{\textgreater}T in aqueous solution indicate
	that cleavage is most likely complete on a picosecond or subpicosecond
	time scale.},

  title = {Ab initio investigation of potential energy curves of the 23 electronic
	states of {IBr} correlating to neutral {2P} atoms},
  journal = {Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {926-940},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Potential energy surfaces for all {Born-Oppenheimer} electronic states
	of {IBr} molecule correlating to the neutral {2P} {(2P3/2} and {2P1/2)}
	iodine and bromine are calculated for the first time. Electric dipole
	and polarizability curves (static and transition) are also determined.
	Calculations include scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects within
	all-electron {Douglas-Kroll} two-component Hamiltonian. Electron
	correlation is treated with quasi-degenerate multi-reference second-order
	perturbation theory. Seven adiabatic electronic states {(X} 1[capital
	Sigma]+, A[prime or minute]3[capital Pi]2, A 3[capital Pi]1, 1 3[capital
	Pi]0-, B 3[capital Pi]0+, B[prime or minute]3[capital Sigma]-0+,
	and 2 3[capital Pi]0+) exhibit significant covalent bonding, and
	can support vibrational states. Calculated spectroscopic parameters
	agree with experiment to better than 1000 cm-1 {(Te),} 10 cm-1 ([small
	omega]e), and 0.05 {[Angstrom]} (re). A new 1 3[capital Pi]0- state
	correlating to ground-state atoms is predicted at Te[approximate]
	14 000 cm-1, [small omega]e[approximate] 80 cm-1, and re[approximate]
	3.0 {[Angstrom].} The second new state (2 3[capital Pi]0+) correlates
	to excited iodine atom, with Te[approximate] 20 000 cm-1, [small
	omega]e[approximate] 115 cm-1, and re[approximate] 3.3 {[Angstrom].}
	Non-adiabatic coupling parameters are calculated for the four avoided
	crossings, which arise due to electronic spin-orbit interaction.
	Estimated parameters of the B 3[capital {Pi]0+/B[prime} or minute]3[capital
	Sigma]-0+ crossing {(Rc[approximate]} 3.32 {[Angstrom];} V[approximate]
	120 cm-1) agree with experimental values. The previously unsuspected
	2 3[capital Pi]0-/1 1[capital Sigma]- crossing of two repulsive surfaces
	provides a new collisional deactivation channel for Br* atoms at
	relative velocities above 1000 m s-1. Several repulsive states (including
	1 1[capital Pi]1 and 2 3[capital Pi]1) intersect the {B/B[prime}
	or minute] system near the avoided crossing point, and may affect
	dynamics of {IBr} in strong laser fields.},

  abstract = {A Dyson orbital theory of molecular photoionization is presented which
	gives the correct approach to the high energy limit, including correlation
	effects in a balanced manner. The photoionization intensity is proportional
	to the mean square of the expectation value of the matter - radiation
	hamiltonian between a pair of Dyson orbitals - one representing the
	outgoing electron, and the other representing the remaining hole.
	The Dyson orbital concept arises naturally in the propagator formulation
	of quantum mechanics. The orbital theory presents advantages in terms
	of case of interpretational and continuity with established work.
	The application to intermediate energies is possibly by means of
	a correction factor representing the mutual correlation between the
	outgoing electron and the remaining hole. This term may be calculated
	in low order using single particle quantities obtained from a one-electron
	propagator calculation. In the very high energy limit the expression
	reduces to the Born and sudden approximation forms.},

	affected the average adiabatic population to only about 5%. For small

	are significantly faster than those with coupling vectors. This relation
	inverts for larger configuration spaces. The use of the partially

	while keeping the deviations in the population below few percent.
	Imidazole and the methaniminium cation are used as test examples.

	the electronic wave function in surface hopping dynamics proceeding
	on adiabatic surfaces are presented providing very stable results
	even in challenging cases of highly peaked nonadiabatic interactions.
	The method was applied to the simulation of transport phenomena in
	the stacked ethylene dimer radical cation and the hydrogen bonded
	2-pyridone dimer. Systematic tests showed the reliability of the
	method, in situations where standard methods relying on an adiabatic
	propagation of the wave function and explicit calculation of the
	nonadiabatic coupling terms exhibited significant numerical instabilities.
	Investigations of the ethylene dimer radical cation with an intermolecular
	distance of 7.0 \AA\ provided a quantitative description of diabatic
	charge trapping. For the 2-pyidone dimer, a complex dynamics was
	obtained: a very fast ({\textless}10 fs) initial {S2/S1} internal
	conversion; subsequent excitation energy transfers with a characteristic
	time of 207 fs; and the occurrence of proton coupled electron transfer
	({PCET)} in 26\% of the trajectories. The computed characteristic
	excitation energy transfer time of 207 fs is in satisfactory agreement
	with the experimental value of 318 fs derived from the vibronic exciton
	splittings in a monodeuterated 2-pyridone dimer complex. The importance
	of nonadiabatic coupling for the {PCET} related to the electron transfer
	was demonstrated by the dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze
	arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein
	design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced
	for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening
	of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach
	that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient
	computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date.
	Previously established computational techniques were used to generate
	an initial design, {HG-1}, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis
	of {HG-1} with molecular dynamics simulations ({MD)} and X-ray crystallography
	indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high
	flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided
	changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the
	interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase,
	{HG-2.} The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition
	state analog ({TSA)} revealed that the {TSA} was bound in the active
	site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically
	relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. {MD}
	analysis of {HG-2} led to an additional point mutation, {HG-3}, that
	produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative
	approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed {MD}
	and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises
	a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic
	catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active
	enzymes.},

	of up to 105 and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms
	that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites,

	to enhance the computational designs produced a {\textgreater}200-fold
	increase in {kcat/Km} ({kcat/Km} of 2,600 M-1s-1 and kcat/kuncat
	of {\textgreater}106). These results demonstrate the power of combining

	excellent agreement with exact results for energies above the threshold

  abstract = {Exact decoupling of positive- and negative-energy states in relativistic
	quantum chemistry is discussed in the framework of unitary transformation
	techniques. The obscure situation that each scheme of decoupling
	transformations relies on different, but very special parametrizations
	of the employed unitary matrices is critically analyzed. By applying
	the most general power series ansatz for the parametrization of the
	unitary matrices it is shown that all transformation protocols for
	decoupling the Dirac Hamiltonian have necessarily to start with an
	initial free-particle {Foldy--Wouthuysen} step. The purely numerical
	iteration scheme applying X-operator techniques to the {Barysz--Sadlej--Snijders}
	{(BSS)} Hamiltonian is compared to the analytical schemes of the
	{Foldy--Wouthuysen} {(FW)} and {Douglas--Kroll--Hess} {(DKH)} approaches.
	Relying on an illegal 1/c expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian around
	the nonrelativistic limit, any higher-order {FW} transformation is
	in principle ill defined and doomed to fail, irrespective of the
	specific features of the external potential. It is shown that the
	{DKH} method is the only valid analytic unitary transformation scheme
	for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Its exact infinite-order version can be
	realized purely numerically by the {BSS} scheme, which is only able
	to yield matrix representations of the decoupled Hamiltonian but
	no analytic expressions for this operator. It is explained why a
	straightforward numerical iterative extension of the {DKH} procedure
	to arbitrary order employing matrix representations is not feasible
	within standard one-component electronic structure programs. A more
	sophisticated ansatz based on a symbolical evaluation of the {DKH}
	operators via a suitable parser routine is needed instead and introduced
	in Part {II} of this work. \copyright 2004 American Institute of

  abstract = {The reaction {CH(X $^2\Pi$)+N$_2$(X $^1\Sigma^*_g$) $\rightarrow$
	HCN(X $^1\Sigma^+$) +N($^4$S)} has been suggested as the initial
	step in the formation of ''prompt'' {NO} in flame fronts. Since the
	reaction is spin-forbidden an intersystem crossing must occur in
	the vicinity of the allowed crossing hypersurface of the lowest doublet
	and quartet potential energy surfaces. In this work the electronic
	structure aspects to this intersystem crossing are considered using
	multireference configuration interaction wave functions. The key
	to this treatment is a new implementation of a constrained analytic
	gradient search algorithm which is used to locate regions of the
	doublet--quartet crossing hypersurface. In those regions of nuclear
	coordinate space the spin--orbit coupling (matrix elements of {HSO)}
	is determined using the full microscopic {Breit--Pauli} spin--orbit
	interaction (that is both the spin--orbit and spin--other--orbit
	contributions are included). Included in this treatment are the largest
	configuration state function expansions, 700000--900000 terms, used
	to date to evaluate matrix elements {HSO} within the full {Breit--Pauli}
	approximation. Our conclusions are as follows. The lowest energy
	point on the doublet--quartet crossing hypersurface corresponds,
	approximately, to a C2v nuclear configuration in which the {HC} moiety
	has been inserted into a highly stretched N2 bond. The spin--orbit
	coupling in this region is approximately 12 cm$^{-1}$. This region
	is estimated to be endoergic with respect to the reactant channel
	asymptote by approximately 7.5 kcal/mol. A second region of the crossing
	hypersurface corresponds to a perturbed nitrogen atom collinearly
	adjacent to the nitrogen side of the {HCN} moiety which is in its
	ground electronic state. The spin--orbit coupling in this region
	is considerably larger, approximately 44 cm$^{-1}$. However, this
	region is estimated to be endoergic with respect to the reactant
	channel asymptote by over 50 kcal/mol. A qualitative {Landau--Zener}
	analysis of the electronic structure data provides the first computational
	evidence supporting the role of this reaction in the production of
	prompt {NO} in flame fronts.},

  abstract = {Nucleophilic catalysis is a general strategy for accelerating ester
	and amide hydrolysis. In natural active sites, nucleophilic elements
	such as catalytic dyads and triads are usually paired with oxyanion
	holes for substrate activation, but it is difficult to parse out
	the independent contributions of these elements or to understand
	how they emerged in the course of evolution. Here we explore the
	minimal requirements for esterase activity by computationally designing
	artificial catalysts using catalytic dyads and oxyanion holes. We
	found much higher success rates using designed oxyanion holes formed
	by backbone {NH} groups rather than by side chains or bridging water
	molecules and obtained four active designs in different scaffolds
	by combining this motif with a Cys-His dyad. Following active site
	optimization, the most active of the variants exhibited a catalytic
	efficiency ({kcat/KM)} of 400 M?1 s?1 for the cleavage of a p-nitrophenyl
	ester. Kinetic experiments indicate that the active site cysteines
	are rapidly acylated as programmed by design, but the subsequent
	slow hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate limits overall catalytic
	efficiency. Moreover, the Cys-His dyads are not properly formed in
	crystal structures of the designed enzymes. These results highlight
	the challenges that computational design must overcome to achieve
	high levels of activity.},

	into the chromosomes a thio-containing analog, then it might be possible
	to sensitize the cell to a second compound having a selective affinity
	for such radicals.Thio-containing compounds, such as 6-mercaptopurine
	and 5-methylthiouracil, did not affect the cytologic picture when
	used alone, whereas 6-thioguanine and 2-thiocytosine did.The compounds
	used further to test the hypothesis, nitrogen mustard and mapharsen,
	both produced marked cytologic abnormalities on these cells.The cytologic
	data obtained showed that the combination of 6-mercaptopurine plus
	nitrogen mustard, 6-thioguanine plus nitrogen mustard, and 2-thiocytosine
	plus mapharsen supported the hypothesis by producing an effect greater
	than when either compound was used alone; and that the union probably
	occurred within the cell.The data also show that 6-mercaptopurine
	and 5-methylthiouracil inactivated the effects of mapharsen, whereas
	it appeared that thioguanine did not combine with mapharsen, nor
	did 2-thiocytosine or 5-methyl thiouracil combine with nitrogen mustard.The
	damage, as evidenced by the cytological studies, was, however, not
	paralleled by increased survival times. This paradox is discussed
	in the text.},

	in simulations only a limited number of discrete continuum levels
	can be considered, the discrete expansion series has to be truncated

  abstract = {For the past several decades, we have been able to directly probe
	the motion of atoms that is associated with chemical transformations
	and which occurs on the femtosecond (10(-15)-s) timescale. However,
	studying the inner workings of atoms and molecules on the electronic
	timescale(1-4) has become possible only with the recent development
	of isolated attosecond (10(-18)-s) laser pulses(5). Such pulses have
	been used to investigate atomic photoexcitation and photoionization(6,7)
	and electron dynamics in solids(8), and in molecules could help explore
	the prompt charge redistribution and localization that accompany
	photoexcitation processes. In recent work, the dissociative ionization
	of H-2 and D-2 was monitored on femtosecond timescales(9) and controlled
	using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses(10). Here we report a
	molecular attosecond pump-probe experiment based on that work: H-2
	and D-2 are dissociatively ionized by a sequence comprising an isolated
	attosecond ultraviolet pulse and an intense few-cycle infrared pulse,
	and a localization of the electronic charge distribution within the
	molecule is measured that depends-with attosecond time resolution-on
	the delay between the pump and probe pulses. The localization occurs
	by means of two mechanisms, where the infrared laser influences the
	photoionization or the dissociation of the molecular ion. In the
	first case, charge localization arises from quantum mechanical interference
	involving autoionizing states and the laser-altered wavefunction
	of the departing electron. In the second case, charge localization
	arises owing to laser-driven population transfer between different
	electronic states of the molecular ion. These results establish attosecond
	pump-probe strategies as a powerful tool for investigating the complex
	molecular dynamics that result from the coupling between electronic
	and nuclear motions beyond the usual {Born-Oppenheimer} approximation.},

	unrestrained state-of-the-art molecular simulation in explicit solvent
	and salt, resolves this apparent paradox and suggests the following
	main conclusions. Stacked dinucleotides 1a and 1b adopt the main
	characteristic features of a single-stranded A and B form, respectively,
	where the relative positions of the backbone and the bases are very
	different. Unexpectedly, the geometry of the stacking of two thymine
	bases, within each dinucleotide, is very similar and is in excellent
	agreement with photochemical and circular dichroism results. Analyses
	of molecular dynamics trajectories with conformational adiabatic
	mapping show that 1a and 1b explore two different regions of conformational
	space and possess very different flexibilities. Therefore, even though
	their base stacking is very similar, these molecules possess different
	geometrical, mechanical, and dynamical properties that may account
	for the discrepancy observed between increased stacking and increased
	photoproduct formations. The computed average stacked conformations
	of 1a and 1b are well-defined and could serve as starting models
	to investigate photochemical reactions with quantum dynamics simulations.},

	known photoproducts follows the irreversible path See pdf 379.pdf
	Thus dimers are distinguished from other photoproducts by the fact
	that they can be monomerized, as well as formed, by ultraviolet irradiation.
	At large incident fluxes of photons the steady-state value of dimers
	depends on wavelength and {pH}, as well as on other characteristics
	of the surrounding medium. The number of dimers in an irradiated
	polynucleotide may be decreased by purely photochemical means, whereas
	this is not true for most other photoproducts, for which continued
	irradiation, irrespective of wavelength, always results in the formation
	of more photoproduct (37). The wavelength dependence of the steady-state
	for dimers is also reflected in the biological activity of irradiated
	transforming {DNA.} This experiment and the fact that photoreactivating
	enzyme plus visible light monomerizes dimers (and has not been demonstrated
	to have any effect on other photoproducts) are the strongest lines
	of experimental evidence that pyrimidine dimers of the cyclobutane
	type are biologically important lesions and can account for a large
	fraction of the effects of ultraviolet light on {DNA} in solution.
	Insofar as {DNA} is one of the more important biological structures,
	such dimers, when formed, account for a large part of the effects
	of ultraviolet radiation on biological systems.},

  abstract = {The simplified unitary group formalism for electronic states introduced
	by Paldus has been recast in a form based on a relatively small table
	of "distinct rows" of the array (or tableau) representatives of the
	appropriate canonical basis functions. This table can be represented
	effectively and compactly in the form of a two-rooted directed graph.
	Each member (configuration function) of the canonical basis is represented
	by a walk connecting the head and tail of the graph, and its canonical
	index (sequence number) can be determined easily and directly from
	information contained in the distinct row table or the graph. The
	calculation of the matrix representation of a quantum mechanical
	operator in the canonical basis can be organized in terms of various
	subgraphs of the distinct row graph, and in terms of certain "loops"
	contained in them. A relatively small number of basic subgraphs can
	be used to generate most of the information needed in the calculation.
	Certain problems associated with matrix elements of products of generators
	of the unitary group remain to be solved before an effective formalism
	for large-scale electronic structure calculations is obtained, but
	it is hoped that the concepts introduced here can provide insight
	which will be helpful in solving these problems.},

  abstract = {The theory of {MCSCF} and {CI} energy derivatives with respect to
	geometrical variations is briefly reviewed with special attention
	given to the {MCSCF} and {MRCI} energy gradients. A computational
	procedure is proposed for {MRCI} energy gradients that does not require
	the solution to any "coupled-perturbed {MCSCF"} equations, it does
	not require any expensive {direct-CI} matrix-vector products involving
	derivative integrals, and it does not require any derivative integrals
	to be transformed from the {AO} basis to the {MO} basis. An additional
	feature is that it does not require any changes to existing {MCSCF}
	gradient evaluation programs in order to compute {MRCI} gradients.
	The only difference in the two cases is the exact nature of the data
	passed to the gradient evaluation program from the previous steps
	in the computational procedure. The additional effort required to
	compute the entire {MRCI} energy gradient vector is approximately
	that required for one additional iteration of the {MRCI} diagonalization
	procedure and for one additional {MCSCF} iteration. For large scale
	{MRCI} wave functions, the {MRCI} energy gradient evaluation should
	only require about 10\% of the effort of computing the wave function
	itself. This computational procedure removes a major computational
	botleneck of potential energy surface evaluation.},

  abstract = {The {COLUMBUS} program system is a collection of Fortran programs
	for performing general multireference single- and double-excitation
	configuration interaction {(MRSDCI)} wave function optimization based
	on the graphical unitary group approach. The program system also
	includes integral generation, {SCF} and {MCSCF} orbital optimization,
	integral transformation, and wave function analysis programs. The
	original program system was written in 1980 to 1981. Since that time,
	it has evolved into one of the most popular {MRSDCI} program systems
	used in the computational chemistry community. The discussion of
	this evolution will include the exploitation of efficient matrix-matrix
	and matrix-vector product computational kernels, the use of generally
	contracted symmetry-adapted orbital basis sets, general Hamiltonian
	diagonalization procedures, energy-based internal walk selection,
	flexible {DRT} specification, improved coupling-coefficient evaluation
	methods, coupled-pair functional and multireference {CPF} capabilities,
	and density matrix construction. The numerous versions of the program
	system that are maintained at different sites and on different computers
	are now in the process of being merged. The source code for this
	combined version will be made available to the computational chemistry
	community. The source code for a specific computer may be generated
	from the source code for another computer by a single pass through
	a simple filter utility that is included with the program system.
	The directly supported computers will initially include various models
	of {VAX}, Cray, {FPS}, {IBM}, {CDC}, and {ETA} machines with the
	addition of other machines shortly thereafter. The ongoing developments
	of the {COLUMBUS} system that are discussed include a new method
	for computing analytic energy gradients for {MRSDCI} wave functions.
	This effective-density-matrix based method avoids the "coupled perturbed
	{MCSCF"} solutions for each coordinate direction, avoids the transformation
	of any derivative-integral quantities from the {AO} to the {MO} basis,
	avoids the transformation of the coupling coefficients from the {MO}
	to the {AO} basis, allows a subset of the {MCSCF} doubly occupied
	orbitals to be frozen in the {CI} wave function, and allows the {MRSDCI}
	wave function to be generated from general reference {CSFs} that
	are not necessarily related to the {MCSCF} expansion {CSFs.}},

	It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values

	to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally,

  abstract = {We present a new inventory of global sulfur dioxide emissions from
	anthropogenic activities for the years 1980--2000. Emissions were
	estimated in 11 world regions using country-level emissions inventories
	and regional fossil fuel sulfur content information. Estimated global
	emissions in 1990 are 72 {TgS} with an estimated uncertainty of $\pm$8\%
	due to random errors with additional systematic errors that suggest
	that true emissions may be higher than this central value. We estimate
	that 56\% of 1990 world emissions are from coal, 24\% from oil, 15\%
	from industrial processes and 3\% from biomass burning. When our
	results are compared with other studies, they are similar at the
	global-mean level, but show marked differences at the regional level.
	Globally, emissions have been roughly constant from 1980 to the present.
	However, a significant shift has occurred in the spatial distribution
	of emissions. While 60\% of global emissions in 1980 were from around
	the North Atlantic basin, this region contributed less than 40\%
	of the global total by 1995 and will contribute even less in the
	future. Currently, based on our estimates, the centrally planned
	Asia {(CPA)} region, dominated by China, is the largest contributor
	to global sulfur dioxide emissions. A gridded data set for 1990 emissions
	is also produced, including a consistent seasonal cycle and a stratification
	of emissions into low and elevated releases. Implications for climate
	modeling and detection studies are discussed.},

	of the relative yields of the cation states populated following ionization
	and compare these to the results of a recently developed ab initio--type
	numerical model designed to compute strong-field ionization of molecules,
	the so-called time-dependent resolution in ionic states ({TD-RIS)}
	method. In analogy with one-photon {XUV} ionization, where the photoionization
	matrix elements can be related to the Dyson orbitals, we construct
	estimates for the yield of strong-field ionization ({SFI)} to different
	cation states based on the Dyson orbital norms and the Keldysh tunneling
	ionization rate. In the case of {XUV} ionization, the Dyson norms
	are shown to be good predictors of the relative cation yields when
	compared with the {TD-RIS} yields. The Dyson- and Keldysh-based models
	underestimate the yield to excited cation states in the case of {SFI.}
	The increased yield to the excited cation states in the {TD-RIS}
	results is attributed to the inclusion of multielectron effects and
	continuum structure not present in the simple models. The molecular
	Ammosov-Delone-Krainov ({MO-ADK)} method of calculating {SFI} is
	also considered. This later method is seen to agree more closely
	with the Dyson- and Keldysh-based estimates as it also fails to capture
	the multielectron effects and continuum structure included in the

  abstract = {{UV} vibronic spectrum for cytosine has been calculated using high-level
	quantum chemistry. Coupled with a careful analysis of the available
	experimental spectra, it is suggested that the spectrum contains
	only two $\pi\pi^*$ transitions; the other two, less resolved bands
	cannot be type $\pi\pi^*$, and are probably not even $n\pi^*$ but
	rather vibrational subbands (see {figure).Theoretical} vertical excitation
	energies and simulated {UV} spectrum are reported for the canonical
	(amino-oxo) form of cytosine. The calculations were performed by
	the {EOM-CCSD} and {EOM-CC3} methods with basis sets up to triple-zeta
	quality. Beyond vertical excitations, the complete vibronic spectrum
	has been determined the first time, using the linear vibronic coupling
	({LVC)} method. On the basis of the computed data, a critical review
	of the available experimental information ({UV} spectra, linear dichroism,
	Resonance Raman and {REMPI} measurements) has led to the surprising
	conclusion that cytosine has only two, rather than four, observable
	electronic transitions in the {UV} range up to 60 000 cm$^{-1}$.
	The result may be of crucial importance for future photochemical
	studies.},

  abstract = {The low-lying excited singlet states of the keto, enol, and keto-imine
	tautomers of cytosine have been investigated employing a combined
	density functional/multireference configuration interaction ({DFT/MRCI)}
	method. Unconstrained geometry optimizations have yielded out-of-plain
	distorted structures of the $\pi\pi^*$ and $n\pi^*$ excited states
	of all cytosine forms. For the keto tautomer, the {DFT/MRCI} adiabatic
	excitation energy of the $\pi\pi^*$ state (4.06 {eV} including zero-point
	vibrational energy corrections) supports the resonant two-photon
	ionization ({R2PI)} spectrum (Nir et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.
	2002, 5, 4780). On its S1 potential energy surface, a conical intersection
	between the 1$\pi\pi^*$ state and the electronic ground state has
	been identified. The barrier height of the reaction along a constrained
	minimum energy path amounts to merely 0.2 {eV} above the origin and
	explains the break-off of the {R2PI} spectrum. The 1$\pi\pi^*$ minimum
	of the enol tautomer is found at considerably higher excitation energies
	(4.50 {eV).} Because of significant geometry shifts with respect
	to the ground state, long vibrational progressions are expected,
	in accord with experimental observations. For the keto-imine tautomer,
	a crossing of the 1$\pi\pi^*$ potential energy surface with the ground-state
	surface has been found, too. Its $n\pi^*$ minimum (3.27 {eV)} is
	located well below the conical intersection between the $\pi\pi^*$
	and S0 states, but it will be difficult to observe because of its
	small transition moment. The identified conical intersections of
	the $\pi\pi^*$ excited states of the keto cytosine tautomers are
	made responsible for the ultrafast decay to the electronic ground
	states and thus may explain their subpicoseconds lifetimes.},

  abstract = {A method is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations
	of processes that involve electronic transitions. The time dependent
	electronic Schr\"odinger equation is solved self-consistently with
	the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each
	integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic
	states, according to probabilistic ''fewest switches'' algorithm.
	If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of
	the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy.
	The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among
	any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical
	probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations
	for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been
	specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical--quantal
	dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial
	indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a

	Nuclei are assumed to move classically on a single potential energy

	split into two branches, each of which follows a different potential

	is assessed by numerical integration of the appropriate semiclassical
	equations. A 3d "trajectory surface hopping" treatment of the reaction
	of H+ with D2 at a collision energy of 4 {eV} is reported. The excellent

	considerably in recent years, due to advances in our understanding
	of points of degeneracy between different electronic states, termed
	{\textquotedblleft}conical intersections{\textquotedblright} {(CIs).}
	{CIs} serve as funnels for population transfer between different
	electronic states, and play a central role in ultrafast photochemistry.
	Because most practical photochemistry occurs in solution and protein
	environments, it is important to understand the role complex environments
	play in directing excited-state dynamics generally, as well as specific
	environmental effects on {CI} geometries and energies. In order to
	model such effects, we employ the full multiple spawning {(FMS)}
	method for multistate quantum dynamics, together with hybrid quantum
	mechanical/molecular mechanical {(QM/MM)} potential energy surfaces
	using both semiempirical and ab initio {QM} methods. In this article,
	we present an overview of these methods, and a comparison of the
	excited-state dynamics of several biological chromophores in solvent
	and protein environments. Aqueous solvation increases the rate of
	quenching to the ground state for both the photoactive yellow protein
	{(PYP)} and green fluorescent protein {(GFP)} chromophores, apparently
	by energetic stabilization of their respective {CIs.} In contrast,
	solvation in methanol retards the quenching process of the retinal
	protonated Schiff base {(RPSB),} the rhodopsin chromophore. Protein
	environments serve to direct the excited-state dynamics, leading
	to higher quantum yields and enhanced reaction selectivity.},

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions on the molecular (femtosecond) timescale
	typically uses pump laser pulses to excite molecules and subsequent
	probe pulses to interrogate them. The ultrashort pump pulse can excite
	only a small fraction of molecules, and the probe wavelength must
	be carefully chosen to discriminate between excited and unexcited
	molecules. The past decade has seen the emergence of new methods
	that are also aimed at imaging chemical reactions as they occur,
	based on X-ray diffraction1, electron diffraction2 or laser-induced
	recollision3, 4--with spectral selection not available for any of
	these new methods. Here we show that in the case of high-harmonic
	spectroscopy based on recollision, this apparent limitation becomes
	a major advantage owing to the coherent nature of the attosecond
	high-harmonic pulse generation. The coherence allows the unexcited
	molecules to act as local oscillators against which the dynamics
	are observed, so a transient grating technique5, 6 can be used to
	reconstruct the amplitude and phase of emission from the excited
	molecules. We then extract structural information from the amplitude,
	which encodes the internuclear separation, by quantum interference
	at short times and by scattering of the recollision electron at longer
	times. The phase records the attosecond dynamics of the electrons,
	giving access to the evolving ionization potentials and the electronic
	structure of the transient molecule. In our experiment, we are able
	to document a temporal shift of the high-harmonic field of less than
	an attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) between the stretched and compressed
	geometry of weakly vibrationally excited Br2 in the electronic ground
	state. The ability to probe structural and electronic features, combined
	with high time resolution, make high-harmonic spectroscopy ideally
	suited to measuring coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring
	in photochemical reactions and to characterizing the electronic structure
	of transition states.},

	The prefix {RI} indicates the use of an approximate resolution of
	identity in the Hilbert space of interacting charge distributions
	{(Coulomb} metric), i.e., the use of an auxiliary basis set to approximate
	charge distributions. The {RI} technique is applied to first derivatives
	of the {MP2} correlation energy expression while the (restricted)
	{Hartree-Fock} reference is treated in the usual way. Computational
	savings by a factor of 10 over conventional approaches are demonstrated
	in an application to porphyrin. It is shown that the {RI} approximation
	to {MP2} derivatives does not entail any significant loss in accuracy.
	Finally, the relative energetic stabilities of a representative sample
	of closed-shell molecules built from first and second row elements
	have been investigated by the {RI-MP2} approach, and thus it is tested
	whether such properties that refer to potential energy hypersurfaces
	in a more global way can be described with similar consistency to
	the more locally defined derivatives.},

  abstract = {A new internally contracted direct multiconfiguration--reference configuration
	interaction {(MRCI)} method is described which allows the use of
	much larger reference spaces than any previous {MRCI} method. The
	configurations with two electrons in the external orbital space are
	generated by applying pair excitation operators to the reference
	wave function as a whole, while the singly external and internal
	configurations are standard uncontracted spin eigenfunctions. A new
	efficient and simple method for the calculation of the coupling coefficients
	is used, which is well suited for vector machines, and allows the
	recalculation of all coupling coefficients each time they are needed.
	The vector H$\cdot$c is computed partly in a nonorthogonal configuration
	basis. In order to test the accuracy of the internally contracted
	wave functions, benchmark calculations have been performed for F-,
	{H2O}, {NH2}, {CH2}, {CH3}, {OH}, {NO}, N2, and O2 at various geometries.
	The deviations of the energies obtained with internally contracted
	and uncontracted {MRCI} wave functions are mostly smaller than 1
	{mH} and typically 3--5 times smaller than the deviations between
	the uncontracted {MRCI} and the full {CI.} Dipole moments, electric
	dipole polarizabilities, and electronic dipole transition moments
	calculated with uncontracted and contracted {MRCI} wave functions
	also are found to be in close agreement. The efficiency of the method
	is demonstrated in large scale calculations for the {CN}, {NH3},
	{CO2}, and Cr2 molecules. In these calculations up to 3088 reference
	configurations and up to 154 orbitals were employed. The biggest
	calculation is equivalent to an uncontracted {MRCI} with more than
	78 million configurations.},

  abstract = {An efficient direct {CI} method which includes all singly and doubly
	substituted configurations with respect to an arbitrary multiconfiguration
	{(MCSCF)} reference function is described. The configurations are
	generated by subsequently applying spin-coupled two-particle annihilation
	and creation operators to the complete {MCSCF} function. This considerably
	reduces the size of the n-electron basis and the computational effort
	as compared to previous multireference {CI} treatments, in which
	the configurations are defined with respect to the individual reference
	configurations. The formalism of the method is very similar to the
	closed-shell ''self-consistent electron pairs'' {(SCEP)} method of
	Meyer. The vector Hc is obtained in terms of simple matrix operations
	involving coefficient and integral matrices. A full transformation
	of the two-electron integrals is not required. Test calculations
	with large basis sets have been performed for the {3B1} and {1A1}
	states of {CH2} {($\Delta$E} = 9.5 kcal/mol) and for the {CH2(3B1)}
	{+H2$\rightarrow$CH3+H} reaction barrier {($\Delta$E} = 10.7 kcal/mol).
	As a preliminary test for the accuracy of the results obtained with
	contracted wave functions of the above type the potential energy
	and dipole moment functions of the {OH} X 2$\Pi$ and A 2$\Sigma$+
	states have been calculated. For the 2$\Pi$ state re and $\omega$e
	deviate by less than 10-3 \AA and 1 cm-1, respectively, from the
	experimental data. For the 2$\Sigma$+ state the agreement is somewhat
	less good, which is probably due to basis set defects. Around the
	equilibrium distance the calculated dipole moment functions are in
	very close agreement with those previously obtained from {PNO--}
	{CEPA} functions.},

  abstract = {A variational method has been used to calculate the low-lying vibration-rotation
	energy levels of various triatomic molecules. The wavefunctions were
	expanded as a linear combination of products of polynomials of the
	normal coordinates multipled by suitable spherical harmonics of the
	Euler angles. The molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonians given
	by Watson for nonlinear (1) and linear (2) molecules were employed.
	Using numerical integration, the method can be applied to any molecule
	for any form of the potential surface.
	
	Calculations have been carried out on the nonlinear triatomics {H2O}
	and {SO2} and the linear system {OCS.} Potential-energy surfaces
	expressed in terms of variables $\Delta$r12, $\Delta$r13, and $\Delta$$\Theta$,
	where $\Delta$r represents a change in bond length and $\Delta$$\Theta$
	a change in bond angle, have been derived by many workers using perturbation
	theory and potential functions of this form were used in the calculations.
	The results for {H2O} indicate that none of the surfaces employed
	are satisfactory. For the best surface, although the band origin
	for the (000)-(010) transition is within 4 cm-1 of the experimental
	value, the band origins for the (000)-(100) and (000)-(001) transitions
	are in error by at least 60 cm-1. The results for {SO2} are much
	closer to experiment, which indicates that perturbation theory is
	more accurate for the potential surface determination in this case.
	The results for {OCS} are similarly much closer to the experimental
	values.
	
	This variational method is recommended as a means of investigating
	the quality of potential surfaces.},

  abstract = {Motivated originally by the goal of steering a photoreaction into
	desired product channels, the concept of coherent control is to adapt
	the spectral and temporal characteristics of the excitation light
	to the inherent molecular resonances and dynamics, such that these
	can be selectively addressed and manipulated. In the last decade,
	the ultrafast dynamics of many atomic and molecular quantum systems
	in the gas and condensed phase have been controlled successfully.
	Motivations in chemistry are now 1) to perform spectroscopy by coherent
	control, which requires a deeper understanding of control mechanisms,
	2) to treat more complex, biological photoreactions, and 3) the pragmatic
	use of coherent control techniques, for example, for pulse compression
	or enhanced contrast in multiphoton microscopy. As examples for 1)
	and 2) we review here the combined effort and interplay of conventional
	spectroscopy and coherent control experiments, applied to the energy
	flow in the light-harvesting complex {LH2} from bacterial photosynthesis.
	Closed-loop control experiments allowed the characteristic coupling
	frequency of internal conversion in the carotenoid in {LH2} to be
	extracted. Open-loop three-pulse control experiments, on the other
	hand, could directly observe an anticipated Raman-excited carotenoid
	ground state. As a variant of difference spectroscopy, coherent control
	has thus served to gain complementary spectroscopic knowledge about
	the energy flow in carotenoids by comparing natural to manipulated
	dynamics. Finally, we propose future coherent control experiments
	on the electronic state structure of carotenoids and discuss prospects
	of coherent control for other biological chromophores.},

	properties of molecules and of long-range atomic and molecular interactions
	between both neutral and charged species. We report a systematic
	study of the basis sets required to obtain accurate correlated values
	for the static dipole ($\alpha$1), quadrupole ($\alpha$2), and octopole
	($\alpha$3) polarizabilities and the hyperpolarizability ($\gamma$)
	of the rare gas atoms He, Ne, and Ar. Several methods of correlation
	treatment were examined, including various orders of {Moller--Plesset}
	perturbation theory {(MP2}, {MP3}, {MP4)}, coupled-cluster theory
	with and without perturbative treatment of triple excitations {[CCSD},
	{CCSD(T)]}, and singles and doubles configuration interaction {(CISD).}
	All of the basis sets considered here were constructed by adding
	even-tempered sets of diffuse functions to the correlation consistent
	basis sets of Dunning and co-workers. With multiply-augmented sets
	we find that the electrical properties of the rare gas atoms converge
	smoothly to values that are in excellent agreement with the available
	experimental data and/or previously computed results. As a further
	test of the basis sets presented here, the dipole polarizabilities
	of the F- and Cl- anions and of the {HCl} and N2 molecules are also
	reported.},

	zeta [5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta [6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined.

	describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and
	p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion {HF} energy,
	while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present
	in the standard set was optimized for the anion {HF+1+2} energy.

	enzymes, that allows rapid evaluation and testing of enzyme design
	methodologies. In the benchmark test, which consists of designing
	sites for each of 10 different chemical reactions in backbone scaffolds
	derived from 10 enzymes catalyzing the reactions, the new methods
	succeed in identifying the native site in the native scaffold and
	ranking it within the top five designs for six of the 10 reactions.
	The new methods can be directly applied to the design of new enzymes,
	and the benchmark provides a powerful in silico test for guiding
	improvements in computational enzyme design.},

	has been investigated by ab initio quantum chemical methods based
	on {CIS} and {CR-EOM-CCSD(T)} electronic energy calculations at optimized
	{CIS} geometries. The calculated potential energy profiles indicate
	that the S1 ? S0 internal conversion of the pyrimidine bases occurs
	through a barrierless state switch from the initially excited 1$\pi\pi^*$
	state to the out-of-plane deformed excited state of biradical character,
	which intersects the ground state at a lower energy. This three-state
	nonradiative decay mechanism predicts that replacement of the C5
	hydrogen by fluorine introduces an energy barrier for the initial
	state switch, whereas replacement of the C6 hydrogen by fluorine
	does not. These predictions are borne out by the very different fluorescence
	yields of 5-fluorinated bases relative to the corresponding 6-fluorinated
	bases. It is concluded from these results that the origin of the
	ultrafast radiationless decay is the same for the two pyrimidine
	bases.},

	initial formation of a diradical followed by ring closure via singlet?triplet

	the concerted singlet state cycloaddition processes. The key geometric
	features and electron spin densities are also discussed. Bulk solvation
	has a major effect by reducing the barriers and increasing the diradical
	stabilities. The present results provide a rationale for the faster
